And, experts say, they have the potential to command millions as an influencer couple.</p><p>On Thursday,<a href=#> Sports Illustrated Swim announced Brittany</a> as a 2024 rookie model.</p><p>“I never in my wildest dreams thought this would happen,” Brittany said in a video, making a perfect nod to Swift’s song “Wildest Dreams.”</p><p>Indeed, it’s safe to guess that becoming friends with the superstar singer is also a dream come true.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“They were kind of tossed into a world of fame.

People look at her as more legit.”&nbsp;</p><p>When Swift, 34, entered Chiefs Kingdom last fall, Hollywood followed —&nbsp;and scooped up Brittany. In September, <a href=#>the news pals dined at Emilio’s Ballato</a> in Nolita with Sophie Turner and Blake Lively.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Days before Patrick leads the Chiefs in SuperBowl LVII, SI announced Brittany as a 2024 SI Swim rookie. <span class=credit>Derek Kettela/Sports Illustrated</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“I never in my wildest dreams thought this would happen,” Brittany said in a statement after SI Swim announced her as rookie model status. <span class=credit>Derek Kettela/Sports Illustrated</span></figure><p>Brittany was also on hand the next day as Swift <a href=#>assembled her celeb squad</a> — including Lively, Turner, Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Sabrina Carpenter — at a Chiefs game against the New York Jets.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the season, Swift and Mahomes posed in <a href=#>custom jackets</a> emblazoned with their other halves’ team numbers and were spotted playing out their own <a href=#>secret handshake</a> as they cheered on the Chiefs.</p><p>“It’s hard at this point to meet people that are true and real and they kind of found each other,” Patrick’s mom, Randi Mahomes, told Page Six this week. “They really, I mean, talk all the time and they’re like, really good friends.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Brittany and Patrick appeared in a Skimms ad for Kim Kardashian’s fashion label with their two kids, 2-year-old daughter Sterling and 1-year-old Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III. <span class=credit>brittanylynee/Instagram</span></figure><p>After Brittany was spotted with Swift, her Instagram following surged by more than 25%&nbsp; — up from 1.4 million followers in August — to nearly 2 million, trend expert Rachel Richardson noted.</p><p>“Brittany was already a social media star before she started hanging with Taylor, but the attention that their friendship has brought has supercharged her profile,” Richardson,<strong> </strong>who writes the trend newsletter<a href=#><strong> </strong>Highly Flammable</a>, told The Post.&nbsp;</p><p>But there is more value to Brittany than just her new identity as Taylor’s pal.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The NFL posted a video of Swift and Brittany cheering on their partners with a secret handshake. <span class=credit>CBS/Sunday Night Football/X</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Swift and Brittany with fellow WAG Lindsay Bell (middle), who is married to Blake Bell, the Chiefs’ tight end. <span class=credit>Brittany Mahomes/Instagram</span></figure><p>“Her marriage to Mahomes is also extremely valuable to marketers … they’d make millions for just one partnership,” Richardson said.</p><p>Last November, the couple and their kids —&nbsp;daughter Sterling, 2, and 14-month-old Patrick Jr., aka Bronze — <a href=#>appeared in a holiday promo</a> for Kim Kardashian’s Skimms fashion line.</p><p>“She’s perfect for brands that want to appeal to moms and homemakers because she’s very open about her family life on Insta posting lots of pictures of her two children and her husband Patrick,” Richardson said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">After Brittany (second from left) was spotted with Swift (left) at a Chiefs game her Instagram following surged by more than 25%. <span class=credit>Instagram/@brittanylynne</span></figure><p>Brittany, a certified fitness trainer, tends to post relatable content on her social media —&nbsp;talking about everything from a Red Lobster menu to her son’s sleep schedule – which makes her a win for marketers.</p><p>Her recent partnership with plant protein shake OWYN, Richardson estimates, likely commanded “in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars” for an Instagram grid post.</p><p>More fashion deals will likely follow, Richardson added: “If a style brand wants Taylor-level exposure but can’t get it then Brittany is the next best vehicle.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In January, Swift and Brittany closed out the Chiefs’ wild-card win over the Dolphins in matching “Kelce” and “Mahomes” jackets designed by Kristin Juszczyk, wife of 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk. <span class=credit>brittanylynne/Instagram</span></figure><p>Patrick and Brittany met while attending Whitehouse High School in Texas, and began dating in 2011.
