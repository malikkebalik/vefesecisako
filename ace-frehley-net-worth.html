He is a musician and songwriter, answering to the nicknames Space Ace and Spaceman. Ace Frehley is perhaps best known as a former member of the popular rock group <a href=#>Kiss</a> (1973–1982, 1996-2002) as well as a solo artist. He has been listed as one of the Greatest Metal Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World magazine, though he was never actually taught to play, and doesn’t know how to read music. Ace Frehley has been accumulating his net worth as a musician since 1964.</p><p>So how much is the Ace Frehley’s net worth? Reportedly, Ace’s wealth stands at $35 million, accumulated during his career in the music industry beginning way back in the early 70s.</p><h3>Ace Frehley Net Worth $35 Million</h3><p>Since birth Ace was surrounded by music, as every member of his family played a musical instrument or two. Getting a guitar as a Christmas present was some sort of a usual gift and he started playing it being 13. Ace claims that he was influenced by such artists as Led Zeppelin, <a href=#>B.B. King</a>, <a href=#>Eric Clapton</a>, <a href=#>Jimi Hendrix</a> and The Rolling Stones. After graduating from high school he played in local bands until he auditioned for and became a founding member of the hard rock band <a href=#>Kiss</a>. Together with the band, Frehley recorded 16 studio albums, and all but two of them received certifications for sales in USA, and many were also certified in Canada, UK, Japan. As a result, they all added to the total size of Ace Frehley’s net worth.</p><p>However, Ace left the band in 1982 in order to pursue a solo career. In fact, the most successful studio album Frehley released was when still being a member of <a href=#>Kiss</a>. His self-titled debut studio album (1978) was certified platinum in the USA and gold in Canada, and peaked in 26th position on the Billboard Album Top 200 in USA. The single “New York Groove” which was included on the above mentioned album peaked in 13th position on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1996 Ace reunited with the band <a href=#>Kiss</a> for a farewell tour, and even though the band agreed to continue afterwards, in 2002 Frehley left the band and continued his solo career. The reunification still added to Ace’s net worth.</p><p>Ace Frehley has released six studio albums, up to date. It should be noted that the latest album “Space Invader” (2014) appeared in high positions of the music charts not only in USA, but also Australia, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. All these albums increased the overall size of Ace Frehley net worth.</p><p>In addition to his work on the stage, Ace Frehley released his autobiography “No Regrets – A Rock ‘N’ Roll Memoir” in 2011, co-written with John Ostrosky and Joe Layden. Frehley was also featured in the television film “<a href=#>Kiss</a> Meets the Phantom of the Park” (1978), and documentary films “Kiss: The Second Coming Documentary” (1998) and “KISS Loves You” (2004), feature films “Detroit Rock City” (1999) and “Remedy” (2005). These have added sums to the net worth of Ace Frehley, too.</p><p>In his personal life, Ace has been married to Jeanette Trerotola since 1976.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=44.487205731832><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ace Frehley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$35 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 27, 1951</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>The Bronx, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Songwriter, Musician, Guitarist</td></tr><tr readability=18><td>Education</td><td>DeWitt Clinton High School, Theodore Roosevelt High School, Grace Lutheran School, I Was Made For Lovin' You, New York Groove, Rock and Roll All Nite, Portland, OR, United States, Buenos Aires, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Monterrey, NL, Mexico</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Monique Frehley</td></tr><tr readability=17><td>Parents</td><td>Carl Daniel Frehley, Esther Anna Hecht, I Was Made For Lovin' You, New York Groove, Rock and Roll All Nite, Portland, OR, United States, Buenos Aires, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Monterrey, NL, Mexico</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Charles Frehley</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Paul Daniel Frehley , Frehley, Ace</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/officialacefrehley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/ace_frehley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/acefrehley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293719</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Awards</td><td>People's Choice Awards for Favorite New Song (1977), Metal Edge Readers' Choice Awards for Bend of the Year, Best Concert Tour and Performance (1996), Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences ("The Recording Academy") Heroes Award, 2006)</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>Albums</td><td>"Kiss"(1974), "Hotter Than Hell" (1974), "Dressed to Kill"(1975), "Destroyer" (1976), "Love Gun" (1977), "Dynasty" (1979), "Lick It Up" (1983), "Revenge" (1992),"Rock and Roll Over" (1976), "Psycho Circus" (1998), "Sonic Boom" (2009), "Best of Kiss 40" (2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Kiss, Frehley's Comet</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>“Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park” (1978), “Kiss: The Second Coming Documentary” (1998), “KISS Loves You” (2004), “Detroit Rock City” (1999), “Remedy” (2005)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>TV Shows</td><td>Academy of Music (New York, 1973), Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium (1974), ABC's Dick Clark's in Concert (1974), American Idol (2009), The Hottest Show on Earth Tour (2010), "Jimmy Kimmel Live!
