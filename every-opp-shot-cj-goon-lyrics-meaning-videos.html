The lyrics are explicit and full of bravado, with the artist calling out other rappers and gang members who he believes to be fake or weak. The chorus repeats the phrase "How you every O shot, nigga, who did you shoot?" which is a reference to the O-block neighborhood in Chicago, known for its history of gang activity and violent crime. The artist also mentions his crew, the OY-OGz, and how they are always ready to back him up in a fight or a shootout.</p><br><p>The verses describe the artist's mindset when he's "creepin'" or looking for a target to attack. He talks about how he's always armed with a gun or a knife, and how he doesn't hesitate to use it if he feels threatened. He also talks about his loyalty to his friends and his willingness to protect them at all costs, even if it means getting into a dangerous situation. The song ends with a shoutout to other members of the OY-OGz, and a final warning to anyone who tries to cross them.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Grrah-grrah, boom maari</u><br>An exclamation of hype and enthusiasm, building energy for what's to come.</p><br><p><u>Word to my mother, these n***as is p***y</u><br>A declaration of the singer's honesty and integrity in calling out others for being cowardly.</p><br><p><u>How you every O-, n***a who did you-</u><br>Challenging another person's claims of violence and asking for proof of their actions.</p><br><p><u>Bap, you a- and you like 5'- back out the-</u><br>Dismissively calling another person a weakling and urging them to retreat before violence ensues.</p><br><p><u>Back out the- and I’m ready to-</u><br>Fearlessly daring the other person to make a move and initiating a fight.</p><br><p><u>OY-OGz wit' me, spinning through</u><br>The singer is accompanied by their trusted friends and associates, ready for action.</p><br><p><u>Bullets they hit him, knock him out his shoes</u><br>The singer boasts of their marksmanship, claiming to be able to knock someone off their feet with a single shot.</p><br><p><u>Tired of the talking, what is we gon' do</u><br>Impatiently calling for action and impatient with those who talk but don't act.</p><br><p><u>I'm a different n***a when I'm creepin'</u><br>The artist is describing their mentality and approach to violence, indicating that they are more dangerous and unpredictable in certain situations.</p><br><p><u>Hop out, I'ma shoot for no reason</u><br>The artist is claiming to be willing to shoot without any specific provocation or motive, projecting an image of recklessness and fearlessness.</p><br><p><u>Brodie, he call me, he said that he need it</u><br>Acknowledging the singer's position as a sought-after provider of violent retribution and/or protection.</p><br><p><u>I told him 'I got him', I'm squeezing</u><br>The artist assures their friend that they are fully capable of carrying out the requested act of violence.</p><br><p><u>Free Squeeze man, you know he a demon</u><br>Shouting out the name of their incarcerated friend Squeeze, and calling him a devilish figure, possibly because of his reputation for violence or cunning.</p><br><p><u>So you know what I'm on</u><br>The singer is emphasizing their commitment to a culture of violence and demonstrating that they are not to be trifled with.</p><br><p><u>Talking on bro and the glizzy is drawn</u><br>Threatening to shoot anyone who disrespects a friend, implying that they are always armed and ready to defend their associates.</p><br><p><u>Keep dissin' my n***as, like we don't perform</u><br>The artist is taking offense at insults directed at their associates and insisting that they are capable of delivering on promises to retaliate.</p><br><p><u>Know we gon' hop out, ain't no talking</u><br>The artist is proclaiming that words will not be necessary to escalate a conflict; actions speak louder than words.</p><br><p><u>Mask on, we gon' scorch 'em</u><br>The singer is preparing to wear a mask to anonymize their actions and shoot their enemies indiscriminately.</p><br><p><u>Fuck is a DThang?
