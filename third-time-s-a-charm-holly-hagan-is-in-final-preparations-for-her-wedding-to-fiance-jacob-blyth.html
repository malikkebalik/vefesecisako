Which one should I choose for the day after our wedding for chilled beach club vibes?”</p><p>Though Hagan revealed she was getting married on a “magical island,” she has not disclosed the exact location.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Holly Hagan’s Wedding Was Postponed Twice</h2><p>This is not the first time Hagan has announced she is getting married. In fact, after initially announcing their engagement in July 2019, Hagan and her boyfriend had already set up a date for tying the knot on two separate occasions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For the first time, Hagan and her boyfriend had planned on getting married around May 2021 in Ibiza. However, they had to cancel their plans after travel restrictions were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The restrictions made it impractical to get married around the time, as guests would have to quarantine for ten days upon returning to the UK after attending the wedding.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following the cancellation of their first marriage plans, the pair rescheduled to walk down the aisle in June 2021 in Portugal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Unfortunately, for the same reasons mentioned before, their second plan didn’t come to fruition, too.</p><p>Hagan took to Instagram to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">share the news</a> with her followers just 45 minutes prior to when they were supposed to tie the knot. There, she and Blyth could be seen discussing the ceremony that ultimately didn’t take place.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>The Wedding Cancellation Came as a Relief</h2><p>In July 2021, Hagan revealed she was actually relieved when the pair's plan to get married fell through.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Hagan, who was set to share her marriage planning journey with her fans in a new series titled Geordie OGs, spoke about it during the virtual launch of the series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>“To be honest, I got quite annoyed at a lot of points just because, a lot of times, I felt like I was being told how I should feel,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“[Producers] were like, ‘tell us how angry upset you are.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I’m not I’m actually relieved…’ As soon as the flights got canceled, I was like, ‘thank God, at least now we don’t have to tell people they’ve got to try and move their flights and they might not get their money back or whatever.’”</p><p>Hagan later <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> that she and her boyfriend wouldn’t be having any magazine covering their big day. She noted it was the most important day of their lives, and she just wanted to focus on enjoying it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKCfobm6eceanpqmXayypbDIp55mnpmWu6SxjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colin-mochrie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Colin Mochrie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./silje-torp-f%C3%A6ravaag-age-wiki-bio-height-workout-net-worth-husband-and-bikini-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Silje Torp Fravaag | Age, Wiki/Bio, height, Workout, Net worth, Husband and Bikini Photo,</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
