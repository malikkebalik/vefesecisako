It may have taken<br>7291 emails to reach a conclusion, but we’re here. Sure, we’re missing some<br>great stuff but you’ve gotta draw the line somewhere.

It works best on joints like<br>the <strong>9th Wonder</strong> produced,<br><strong>Skyzoo</strong> assisted You Already Know, or <strong>Tommy Tee</strong>’s throbbing Church featuring the <strong>Loudmouf Choir.</strong><strong>”<br>Rating: 4</strong></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>More or less, this is Monkey<br>Barz 2. The “is this really <strong>Ruck</strong>?” factor wore off, but the dope<br>rhymes and stick-up-rapper element still kept me interested. “Hearing<br>Aid” might be <strong>Khrysis</strong>‘ best<br>beat to date, as <strong>Sean Price</strong> used his<br>revamped popularity to push <strong>Duck Down</strong><br>into uncharted waters – going beyond Brooklyn in so many ways. The success<br>story of ‘05 isn’t going anywhere.

And after nine months,<br>an album with <strong>Aftermath</strong>’s <strong>Bishop Lamont</strong> and countless bangers<br>with <strong>Pharoahe Monch</strong>, <strong>Guilty Simpson</strong> and more; I’m convinced<br>that <strong>Black Milk</strong> is the real deal.<br>Proving doubters he’s not just a <strong>Dilla</strong><br>clone, he’s creating his own lane and pushing the petal to the floor. The 4/5<br>stands but don’t be surprised if he pulls a 5 out with a future project! – <strong>Joel Zela</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album03.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Overall, the album has a good number of standout tracks that will interest a<br>majority of the independent hip-hop fans, especially the <strong>Alchemist </strong>and <strong>Slug </strong>tracks, where <strong>Evidence </strong>seems at his most<br>honest and most hungry.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>:<br><strong>Evidence</strong> has never been the most<br>dynamic lyricist, his voice drones after a while and his beats generally sound<br>pretty similar. Needless to say I wasn’t expecting much from an entire album of<br>just him, boy was I wrong. The Weatherman<br>LP featured some of the year’s best production from <strong>The Alchemist</strong>, a great guest list and <strong>Ev</strong> really spreading his wings as an artist. Most definitely a 4 out<br>of 5. – <strong>J-23</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album04.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br><strong>“</strong><strong>El-P</strong>‘s hyper-intelligent<br>paranoia raps are every bit as cinematic and affecting as his 2025<br>post-apocolypse New York soundtracks. Decipher it as you may, but I’ll Sleep When You’re Dead is such<br>an incredibly fitting title, for reasons you can’t even<br>really articulate.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>El-P</strong> has always had one song on<br>every album that sticks with me. I’ll Sleep When You’re Dead followed on<br>the complete-creativity seen with <strong>Cage</strong>’s<br>Hell’s Winter as another ‘90s underground non-conformist caters to<br>hipsters and hardcore Hip Hoppers with an album that challenges <strong>Lil’ Wayne</strong> and <strong>Juelz</strong> on its “can’t feel my face” factor. I’d never play it for<br>anybody besides myself, in headphones or alone in the whip, but <strong>El-Producto</strong> became <strong>El-Super-Producario</strong> with some help from his friends.

On<br>his classic Who’s That Man, Moma? he told us “look at these balls, they’re so big/the hairs<br>on’em look like two big old afro wigs,” a line made infinitely<br>funnier when heard with his sleepy, smoked out drawl.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>I’ll always love a rapper who<br>rhymes about the problems of a Blues singer: weed, wine and women. Although it<br>falls short of the classic Just Tryin’ Ta<br>Live in timelessness and originality, <strong>Devin</strong>,<br>a modest, blue-collar emcee, really stood out in his state and the state of Hip<br>Hop. “What A Job” belongs on the concrete definitive 2007 playlist.<br>Rating Now: 4/5 – <strong>Jake Paine</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album06.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Don’t be foolish enough to expect any new and improved <strong>Reggie Noble</strong>, he may not be<br>permanently clad in a bubble goose, timbs and a tissue stuck up his nose that<br>PPP shit, but Red Gone Wild is still some good<br>ol’ Brick City mashin.” Rating: 4<strong></strong></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>This album was the first <strong>Redman</strong> effort that worked without the<br>visual aid of dope videos. Though I’m forever bound to <strong>Reggie Noble</strong> over <strong>Erick<br>Sermon</strong> production, “Put It Down” deserved to be the single, as <strong>Redman</strong> (along with <strong>Ghost</strong>) were the artists that upheld the <strong>Def Jam</strong> name in ’07, despite fickle marketing budgets. A great<br>set-up for <strong>Gilla House</strong> to be<br>Jersey’s <strong>Theodore Unit</strong>.

Don’t expect to see his <strong>Aftermath</strong> album anytime…ever, so keep<br>this one within close reach. The production isn’t anything to write home about,<br>but this is still a 4 cause the lyrics are that<br>good. –<strong>J-23</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album09.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“The real gem here has to be The Radar with<br>one of hip hop’s all-time great producers in <strong>Large<br>Professor</strong> on the mic. If you weren’t sure <strong>Marco</strong> was a dedicated student<br>of the <a href=#>game</a>, just listen to how well he channels <strong>Extra P</strong> on the boards here,<br>crazy shit.” Rating: 3.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>With<br>a line up boasting the likes of <strong>Kool G<br>Rap</strong>, <strong>Masta Ace</strong>, <strong>Largo Pro</strong> (on the mic!), <strong>OC</strong> and more, hopes were high. From the<br>“hip hop is not dead” callings on the intro to the left field <strong>J*Davey</strong> finish, PA is hip hop. Though it’s not the classic I’d hoped for it’s<br>definitely worth the purchase. 4/5. – <strong>Joel<br>Zela</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album10.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“<a href=#>Hip hop</a> these days really isn’t much different than a Happy<br>Meal; cheaply manufactured, mass-produced, no nutrition, childish, full of<br>gimmicks and unsatisfying, fake beef. 20 years ago, before the <a href=#>game</a> became likened to the Golden Arches, Hip hop’s beef was<br>slow cooked and left you drooling for more. In those days, if you tried to sit<br>at the table with <strong>KRS One</strong>, you<br>got ate.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>Truth be told, <strong>Kris</strong> and <strong>Marley</strong> uniting nearly 20 years later looked better on paper than it<br>truly sounded. Though <strong>Marley</strong> could<br>have retooled some kicks and snares for some nostalgia sake, this album got <strong>Kris</strong> the attention he deserves, and<br>reminded me that <strong>Koch</strong> does more than<br><strong>Dipset</strong> lately. After a bunch of<br>rushed releases, this is arguably the most meaningful album since <strong>Tha Teacha</strong> left Jive, and a really<br>elaborate press campaign (<strong>50</strong><br>interviewing <strong>KRS</strong>) brought me in<br>further. Rating Now: 4/5 – <strong>Jake Paine</strong><strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album11.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“A title like Desire can be taken in any number<br>of ways. One way is to assume he is alluding to his desire to create timeless<br>art. When so much music is just churned out in the interest of making a quick<br>buck, it is impossible not to take notice when an artist of this caliber<br>displays their craft at the highest level.” Rating: 4.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>When<br>I first heard Desire I took the role<br>of a “new” fan. Rather than bitching and moaning about not having this 10 years<br>ago, I popped the disc in with no expectations. Consensus: <strong>Pharoahe</strong> is dope! <strong>J-23</strong><br>hit the nail on the head by saying “other” rappers need to step their fucking<br>games up. 4.5/5 – <strong>Joel Zela</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album12.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Finding Forever is in some ways a<br>follow up to Be, but in some ways it’s also what<br>Be should have been. In hindsight<br>especially, Be lacked a real edge in the latter<br>half of the album and drifted into boredom. Finding Forever<br>doesn’t suffer from that affliction, and the slower joints are among the best<br>of the LP.” Rating: 4.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>: After<br>a few months I’ve come to realize Finding<br>Forever wasn’t as good as I wanted<br>it to be. It just so happened to be a good album amongst a stale Hip Hop scene.<br><strong>Common</strong>’s<br>lyrics at times are poignant (“Start The Show” and “The Game”) and other times<br>it feels like he’s on cruise control (“Break My Heart” and “I Want You”).<br>Compared to some of the better releases this year, it doesn’t hold up and it’s<br>replay value is diminished. I’ve gotta knock this one back to a 4 out of 5. – <strong>Andreas Hale</strong><strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album13.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Truth is, if <strong>UGK</strong> had cut<br>their output in half, they would have had the true definition of a ‘classic’<br>long player on their hands. Ultimately, what <strong>UGK </strong>is a real contender for<br>2007 album of year, and that’s nothing to sneeze at.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>A double disc suffers the<br>same problem it did in 1998 – a little too much fat on the steak. But with so<br>much to say after so long apart, I never excused it more than with <strong>UGK</strong>’s swan song. “International<br>Player’s Anthem” drew so many in, but this album really had a carefully<br>constructed theme and reintroduction to the kiddies. With <strong>Gang Starr, Pete & CL</strong> and so many duos going out with beef and<br>bitterness, <strong>UGK</strong> not only surprised<br>charts, it was a role model to Hip Hop. I’m proud to look at this beauty on my<br>CD tower in the box-set slot with <strong>The<br>Temptations</strong> and <strong>Rolling Stones</strong>. <strong>Pimp C</strong>’s tragic death makes this disc<br>the one for historians to begin with in their truest understanding of slab<br>genius.

He sticks to production that fits his style rather than try and<br>force himself outside of the box, and pens an album full of <a href=#>lyrics</a> that remove any doubt as to why he has the reputation<br>that he does.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong></strong><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>To<br>be honest, I wasn’t expecting greatness with Eardrum. I was dead wrong. <strong>Talib</strong><br>delivers in every way shape and form. After the shock that hit me over <strong>Talib</strong> picking a production team and<br>sound that actually WORKS I’m still blown away. I’d bump this to 4.5/5. – <strong>Joel Zela</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album15.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Labor Days is easily the crowd<br>favorite and there is nothing here that can touch Daylight<br>or No Regrets, but there are also<br>isn’t three snoozers here anchoring down the last half of the album. Time will<br>tell which body of work is better, for now, just enjoy one of 2007’s dopest<br>albums.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>: I’m<br>still in a trance from the hypnotic beat of the title track. <strong>Aesop Rock</strong><br>is an acquired taste, but if you sit and analyze him long enough, you too will<br>realize that None Shall Pass is way<br>ahead of its time. <strong>Ghostface</strong>’s<br>melanin deficient brother from another mother to has done it again – even if<br>you don’t know what the hell he’s talking about until listen 77,627. The 4 out<br>of 5 stands – <strong>Andreas Hale</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album16.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“While “keeping it real” seems to be the “cool” thing to do with most rappers, <strong>Blu</strong> does this simply because he<br>wants his story to be heard. Comfortable enough in his own skin, he lays it ALL<br>out there … not just concentrating on the extremes.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>: Sometimes<br>an album falls into your lap and you look up and thank God for blessing you<br>with it. Below The Heavens is one of<br>those albums. Don’t know where to get it (legally) so this is one of those<br>times I thank the digital gods for bootlegging and file sharing. If it weren’t<br>for that, I wouldn’t have heard of <strong>Blu</strong><br>and one of the finest debut albums in years. Easily a 4. – <strong>Andreas Hale</strong><strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album17.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Graduation was built around a<br>concept that <strong>Kanye</strong> wanted<br>an album to sound good while he performed in front of tens of thousands in huge<br>arenas with ear popping <a href=#>sound systems</a>. Production wise, <strong>Kanye</strong> accomplishes this for the<br>most part. Big sounding production sprinkled with synthesizers is prevalent<br>throughout the album and accomplishes exactly what <strong>Kanye</strong> set out to do.” Rating:<br>4.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>:</strong><strong></strong>It isn’t flawless by any means, but even<br>a few months later I think this one is going down as a classic. I can’t put my<br>finger on it, the album has just got that special feelings to it. Say what you<br>want about <strong>Kanye</strong>, but more artists<br>need to care about their music as much as he does. I’ll call it a 5 now and get<br>ahead of the curve. – <strong>J-23</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album18.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Without <strong>9th</strong> anchoring the<br>album, it most definitely has a different feel. Not anything too radical, but<br>surely more dynamic. I would rank it somewhere between The Minstrel Show and The Listening at this point, but<br>we’ll see how it plays in time. Either way, whomever, whatever or where ever<br>they were getting back, they got it.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>: After<br>a few months of bumping Getback, I<br>realize that <strong>LB</strong><br>didn’t need <strong>9th Wonder</strong><br>to craft a fantastic album. With <strong>Phonte</strong><br>staking claim as today’s finest everyman emcee and <strong>Big Pooh</strong><br>shutting down naysayers who questioned his ability (check his verses on<br>“Sirens” and “After The Party” for proof), <strong>Little Brother</strong><br>is the group everyone will appreciate long after their gone. The honesty, humor<br>and knack for weaving interesting concepts with exceptional lyricism forces me<br>to bump that 4 to a 4.5.<strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album19.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Where this ranks amongst <strong>Jay</strong>’s<br>catalogue will be determined as time passes. It certainly isn’t perfect, but it<br>has a quality that should resonate into something special. Maybe he said it<br>best himself a decade ago; ‘last year when niggas thought<br>it was all up/this year, I did it again…Jigga, what the fuck?!?’”<br>Rating: 4.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>: As<br>one of the few people who really liked Kingdom<br>Come, I have to say that I was pleased with <strong>Jay-Z</strong>’s<br>drastic gearshift on American Gangster.<br>The rise and fall of the drug dealer is a tale few can weave as intricate as <strong>Hov</strong>.<br>It was as if he was showing today’s dopeboy rappers that this is how it should be done on record. The lyrics, the<br>production, the concepts are all on point – although I have come to realize<br>that I hate Hello Brooklyn. The 4.5<br>sustains in my book. – <strong>Andreas Hale</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album20.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“It’s a rarity to find an all-star cast like this on any album, particularly<br>these days. Spell My Name Right has the<br>distinction of being one of the very few hip hop compilation albums that works<br>as well in practice as it looks on paper, making it definitely worth your<br>while.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>:<br>I don’t think there was a more pleasant surprise this year than <strong>Statik</strong>’s debut album. Everyone knew he<br>was a good mixtape DJ, but to produce a full album this good? He really set<br>himself apart from his peers with this one. 4 out of 5. – <strong>J-23</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album21.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Though the exceptional outside contributions make it easy to do so,<br>overlooking <strong>Freeway’s</strong> own performance would<br>be criminal. His freewheeling, high-octane flow continues to contribute as much<br>musicality as his producers’ beats.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>:<br><strong>Freeway</strong> is a bit of an acquired<br>taste, and really, I only listened to his debut for the red hot production. So<br>with no <strong>Just</strong> or <strong>Ye</strong> this time? I was barely interested. Free improved 10 fold and<br>the producers filled in admirably for the Roc stars. I may lean a little closer<br>to a 3.5, but 4 isn’t a stretch at all. – <strong>J-23</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album22.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Much like A Piece of Strange, Dirty Acres is<br>increasingly refined and mature. The clowning around on Will Rap For Food and Southernunderground is all but<br>gone, as are the up-tempo beats. Gone are fire filled tracks like The South, replaced by a serious<br>and often somber tone.” Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>:<br>“Note to the industry: STOP SLEEPING ON <strong>KNO</strong>!<br>Dirty Acres is a beautifully produced<br>piece of work that is recommended for anyone who loves good music. Say what you<br>want about <strong>Deacon</strong> and <strong>Natti</strong>, but front on <strong>Kno</strong> and I may be forced to fight you. Sooner<br>or later someone will take notice of <strong>Cunninlynguists</strong>’<br>run of great albums. <strong>Dirty Acres</strong><br>gets a 4.25 from me. I know it doesn’t exist but that’s what these columns are<br>for and dammit I’m the editor!” – <strong>Andreas<br>Hale</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album23.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br><strong>“</strong>It’s not very difficult to track<br>the path of <strong>Ghost</strong>‘s success – it all comes<br>down to consistency. Whereas his <strong>Wu </strong>brethren’s<br>albums saw a great drop in quality after their debuts, nearly every one of <strong>Ghost’s </strong>albums has lived up to<br>his potential. With his raw lyricism, storytelling ability and charisma, it is<br>ultimately his tremendous ear for beats that has carried him” Rating: 4.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>:<br>The only guarantees in life are supposed to be taxes and tombstones. 7 albums<br>deep and it looks like Ghost is trying to add his name to that ol’ adage.<br>Pretty Tony knocks’em out the box every time, and Big Doe is his best work in a<br>decade. Ironman indeed, easy 4.5. – <strong>J-23</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album24.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“Back with longtime label <strong>Rap-A-Lot</strong>, <strong>Scarface</strong> treads plenty of<br>familiar territory; murder, drugs, ho’s, money, love, pain. Doesn’t sound like<br>the most appetizing menu, but when one of hip hop’s greatest lyricists and<br>storytellers is the one cooking it up, best believe you’ll be satisfied.”<br>Rating: 4</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong><strong>: </strong>Like <strong>KRS-One</strong>, ‘<strong>Face</strong> is a man<br>of contradictions – a Muslim who never turns his back on Jesus. A loyal <strong>Rap-A-Lot</strong> emcee who’s always in search<br>of a better deal. Though it falls light-years short of The Fix, this is<br>an album that provided streetcorner wisdom from a name you can trust, as “Girl<br>U Know” and “Never” became the biggest singles of fourth quarter ‘07 that radio<br>expectedly ignored without any reason. This one has longer play than most of<br>rap’s disposable art as of late. Rating Now: 4/5 – <strong>Jake Paine</strong><strong></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/columns_editorials/20071218FTOP25_album25.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What We Said Then</strong>:<br>“As far as narratives go, there aren’t many who can claim the same space of<br>storytelling superiority as <strong>Fiasco</strong>. The Cool plays out like a novel<br>filled with short stories that relate to each other in some way, shape or<br>form.” Rating: 4.5</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>What We Say Now</strong>:<br>Hard to give any real retrospect to this one, given I’ve had it for all of a<br>week. But yeah…I think dude can rhyme. He’s the Junior Monster of the Double<br>Entendre.
