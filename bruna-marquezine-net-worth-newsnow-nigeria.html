She is best known for starring in the soap opera “Em Familia”.</p><p>Having been a regular presence on television since the age of four, Marquezine has had a successful career. Sources estimate her net worth at $3 million.</p><h3>Bruna Marquezine Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>Under the professional name Bruna Marquezine, the actress made her industry debut in 1999 when she was cast by director Cininha de Paula for the soap opera “Mulheres Apaixonadas”. Her portrayal of Salette in the show made her a well-known figure, and she continues to be recognized by that character’s name to this day. As a child, she also frequently collaborated with presenter and children’s pop star Xuxa, mostly appearing in commercials. In 2005, she took on the challenging role of a blind character, Maria Flor, in “America”. At the age of 15, her career gained momentum, and she became involved in numerous projects, featuring in shows such as “Cobras and Lagartos”, “Negocio da China”, and “Salve Jorge”. In the 2014 soap opera “Em Familia”, she was one of three actresses to play the lead character “Helena”. The show ran for 143 episodes and was the lowest rated telenova of all time in the 9pm slot, subsequently reduced to 75 episodes for international release.</p><p>Marquezine has also made appearances in movies, though her cinematic work is not extensive. Her first cinematic role was alongside Xuxa in “Xuxa Abracadabra”. Her most recent film credit was in 2015 with “Breaking Through”, an American film. It is mainly her varied work in television that has contributed to her $3 million net worth. In 2003, she was part of a stage play, “Cosquinha”, but has not been involved in theater since.</p><p>She has been nominated for and won several awards. For her role in the show “Women in Love”, she won the “Contigo Prize! TV’s Best Child Actress”. In 2008, she won the “Best Actress” award for her work in the show “Negocio da China”. In 2014, she was honored with the “Most Stylish” award at the Capricho Awards. Additionally, in 2013, Marquezine was voted by “VIP Magazine” as the third sexiest woman in the world, ranking one place ahead of comedian and television presenter Sabrina Sato.</p><p>In her personal life, Marquezine has gained a large following on social media, including 18 million Instagram followers and over 4 million Twitter followers. She is known for her on-again, off-again relationship with professional football player and captain of the Brazilian team, Neymar. They began dating in 2013, and after a year-long break, were seen together again during the 2014 World Cup. With a net worth of $90 million himself, the couple has a comfortable combined wealth. Their relationship has raised Marquezine’s profile outside of Brazil, and she is occasionally mentioned in connection with him in British tabloids. A Catholic, she has a younger sister, Luana, who also appears in soap operas.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bruna Marquezine</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 4, 1995</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiZq62elnqurdGqrJ6ymaOybrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chubby-checker.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chubby Checker</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./after-divorce-lisa-cadette-detwiler-moved-on-her-marrying-prominent-tv-host-husband.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>After Divorce, Lisa Cadette Detwiler Moved On Her Marrying Prominent TV Host Husband.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
