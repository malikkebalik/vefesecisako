Titled “Dirty Iyanna” as a reference to his rumored ex-girlfriend from <strong>Iyanna Mayweather</strong>, who is the daughter of boxing star <strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong>, the track definitely goes into his mixed feelings about how things ended. “Your haze was cruel, Iwasfooled/I was tooblind to see,” he croons in auto-tune in the track.&nbsp;Though that might seem controversial enough, the rapper went as far to remix the iconic 1988 <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> tune “Dirty Diana”, and fans were NOT having it!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“No I won’t let y’all hype up this Dirty Diana remake. That s–t is pure trash,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@IanHow33</a> wrote on Twitter, echoing the sentiment of many other fans. “The Fact That I Thought ‘Man Someone Should Remake Dirty Diana’ then i see that is funny asf 😂😂😂YoungBoy too much,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Astrodope</a> added, while <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Kameron_Hay</a> wondered “Who approved this NBA YoungBoy “Dirty Diana” remix?” Other fans were critical of younger listeners not knowing their music history! “Now every child born after 2010 is going to think NBAYoungboy’s new song is original and we’ll be explaining “Dirty Diana”… I HAAAAATE it here!!!!” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@StephSays503702</a> wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In the video, a masked woman could be seen breaking into YoungBoy’s home. “She slice the tires on my car,” he says in the tune, as the woman can be seen damaging one of his vehicles — yikes! The 20-year-old can also be seen enjoying his estate as he plays video games, likely a reference to his upcoming house arrest for violating his May probation. The woman — clearly a trespasser — is then caught by the rapper’s security before the removing her to mask to reveal that she is Iyanna herself!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who approved this NBA YoungBoy "Dirty Diana" remix?</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— 500 🏎 (@Kameron_Hay) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 12, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Fact That I Thought “Man Someone Should Remake Dirty Diana” then i see that is funny asf 😂😂😂YoungBoy too much</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— FAT$ the Amazon Driver™️🛸 (@Astrodope) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 12, 2019</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“After heartbreak I cut off relations/But I be thinking ’bout you on the daily,” YoungBoy also sings on the track, but the video seems to imply that the two are on good terms after drama from earlier this year: in the spring, YoungBoy called out Iyanna for slashing the tires on his Maybach — which is exactly what’s described in the track — but she denied that she ever did so.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ze5BrZqeakWLGsMHNoJmosV2nsq6typ6qZqWZmLWisctmoZqbm6i8r3nDoqmtsV2ZtqK6wGadmqZdqcSmsdOsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ali-larter-net-worth-pulptastic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ali Larter Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lyrics-to-spirits-by-the-strumbellas-spirits-lyrics-reveals-the-strumbellas-spirits-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lyrics to Spirits by The Strumbellas, Spirits Lyrics, Reveals The Strumbellas Spirits Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
