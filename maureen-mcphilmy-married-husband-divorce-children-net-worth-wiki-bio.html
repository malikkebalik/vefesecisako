It is not under anyone’s control and the obstacles it creates can be overwhelming. The only thing one can do is weather the storm and move on.</p><p>Like many, <strong>Maureen E. McPhilmy</strong> is also soldiering on with her life after facing the problems of her past. Let us peek into her life and learn about her journey along with her relationships, net worth, and wiki-bio.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Maureen_E_McPhilmy%E2%80%99s_Relationship_Status></span>What is Maureen E.&nbsp;McPhilmy’s Relationship Status?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Maureen E. McPhilmy is in a committed marriage&nbsp;with husband&nbsp;<strong>Jeffrey Gross</strong>. He is a country police detective and a widower and has two teenage children from his previous marriage with <strong>Kathleen McBride</strong>,&nbsp;who passed away&nbsp;from cervical cancer in 2006. But he is not the only one with a past. Before Jeffery, Maureen was in a relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bil</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">l</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> O’Reilly</a>.</p><p>Maureen was in a married relationship with the political commentator Bill O’Reilly since November&nbsp; 2, 1996. The two had met years before in 1992 and started dating. They tied the knot in St. Brigid Parish of Westbury.</p><p>The couple together has a daughter,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madeline O’Reilly</a> </strong>and a son, <strong>Spencer O’Reilly</strong>. However, the duo couldn’t stick together and separated on April 2, 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/349AC74300000578-0-image-a-.gif><p>Their divorce was finally official on September 1, 2011, and Maureen spoke up about the breakup. It turns out, Bill physically assaulted her and abused her before they ended things.&nbsp;Things were bad to the point that Bill had dragged her down a staircase by the neck once.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Roginsky Relationships</a></strong></p><p>Their seventeen-year-old daughter also claimed that she witnessed the physical abuse at the couple’s house in Manhattan, New York. They had a&nbsp;bitter court battle over the custody of their two children.</p><p>The duo’s dispute ended in April 2015 and the Nassau County Supreme Court justice gave the custody to Maureen. Later, Maureen and Jeffery got together.</p><p><strong>YouTube: Maureen McPhilmy claimed her former husband Bill O’Reilly physically assaulted her</strong></p><p></p><p>But things didn’t end there as Bill seemed upset with the pair and he went on a rampage to ruin the career of Jeffrey just out of anger and jealousy. Also, he tried to eliminate Maureen from the membership of the Catholic Church. But it’s the past as McPhilmy and Gross are now living a happy life as they raise their four blended kids together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Maureen_E_McPhilmy%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth></span>Maureen E. McPhilmy’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Maureen McPhilmy’s estimated net worth is around <strong>$10 million</strong>. The exact amount of her worth remains a mystery for the public. But reports suggest that she got the fortune after her divorce settlement from Bill.</p><p>Normally, an average public relations executive earns <strong>$176,545</strong> to <strong>$270,733</strong> per year. So, since Maureen is a public relations executive, she earns in the same range.</p><p><strong>Don’t Miss: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Boothe Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>She currently resides with Jeffery in a <strong>$4 million</strong> house in New York Long Island.
