We‚Äôll reveal all the information we know about Fire Force season 3, including the trailer, plot, and other details.</p><p>Are you prepared for more Devil‚Äôs Footprints adventures, Fire Force fans? The long-awaited Season 3 has been formally revealed! Here is all we currently know about its impending release.</p><p>According to the anime‚Äôs official Twitter account, the second season of the Fire Force anime was officially confirmed on May 16, 2022.</p><p>The popular dark fantasy series is based on the same-named manga that Atsushi Okubo wrote and drew in September 2015. Later, it was turned into an animated series for the first and second seasons, which debuted in July 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Fans have been anxiously awaiting the return of this anime. Before the production team revealed the continuation of the series, almost two years had passed since the last season aired.</p><p>Discover what to anticipate from Fire Force Season 3 by reading on!</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>My Hero Academia Chapter 359 Spoiler, Story, Leaks, And Where To Read Online</a></p><h2>Fire Force Season 3 Is It Renewed?</h2><p>Yes, Fire Force Season 3 has been formally renewed for 2023.</p><h2>Fire Force Season 3 Release Date</h2><p>The third Fire Force season has not yet announced a release date. As 2022 is about to come to a conclusion, we can anticipate that the anime will air the following year.</p><p>Additionally, according to reports, the third season of this anime series will run in July 2023, just like the first two seasons did.</p><p>Once more information is confirmed, we‚Äôll post it on Anime Patrol.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=noopener>#BREAKING</a>: Fire Force Season 3 Officially Announced</p><p>üî• READ: <a href=#>https://t.co/uir5ahrqlw</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FsdvDHjfXa</a></p><p>‚Äî Fire Force EN (@FireForceAnime) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 16, 2022</a></p><h2>Fire Force Season 3 Cast</h2><p>The cast for ‚ÄúFire Force‚Äù Season 3 has not yet been officially announced. Based on the stability behind-the-scenes of the show‚Äôs first two seasons, it‚Äôs likely that most of the cast will be back.</p><p>The only new characters in the cast were Ogun Montgomery, who was portrayed by Makoto Furukawa (Japanese) and Zeno Robinson (English), and Scop, who was performed by Tyler Walker (Japanese) and Kentaro Ito (Japanese) (English).</p><p>The voice cast should still be present, with Gakuto Kajiwara (Japanese) and Derick Snow (English) portraying Shinra (Via Anime News Network).</p><p>The same studio, David Production, should return to animation Season 3 much as it did for the first two seasons. For Season 2 of ‚ÄúFire Force,‚Äù Tatsuma Minamikawa will take over for Yuki Yase as director. Unless otherwise noted, it is expected that Minamikawa will also serve as the show‚Äôs director for season 3, in addition to chief animator Kazuhiro Miwa and composer Kenichiro Suehiro.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>One Piece Chapter 1048 Delayed, New Release Date And Time Confirmed</a></p><h2>Fire Force Season 3 Plot</h2><p>For Season 3 of ‚ÄúFire Force,‚Äù no definite plot information is available. Since the anime has primarily followed the manga, we can probably predict what Shinra‚Äôs third season will involve. Season 1 of the anime covered volumes 1 through a portion of volume 11, while Season 2 covered the remainder of volume 11 through a bit of volume 20. Unless the anime series deviates into filler territory like ‚ÄúNaruto‚Äù or ‚ÄúBleach,‚Äù which would happen if the manga is actually at its conclusion, Season 3 might adapt volume 20 up to the story‚Äôs potential conclusion.</p><p>The Season 2 finale seems to hint at a future conflict between Company 8 and the Evangelists that might be much more important. Shinra was pushed in his training to a new level known as ‚ÄúThe Press Of Death‚Äù to get stronger to deal with the Company‚Äôs increasingly deadly enemy.</p><p>The assassination of Captain Hague of Company 4 in the season finale also delivered the heroes a devastating blow. Shinra can create an Adolla Link and witness Hague‚Äôs final moments thanks to his improved ability. These events will probably be followed in Season 3 as Company 8 teams up with the Tokyo Empire to combat the Evangelist‚Äôs powerful troops.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Blue Exorcist Season 3 Release Date, Cast, Plot & All We Know So Far</a></p><h2 id=Fire_Force_Season_1_and_2_Story>Fire Force Season 1 and 2 Story</h2><p>A specialized fire brigade is required at a time and place where spontaneous human body combustion is frequent to prevent individuals from igniting and transforming into monsters.</p><p>A third-generation pyrokinetic kid with the moniker ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Footprints,‚Äù Shinra Kusakabe joins the Special Fire Force Company 8 to stop the infernal assaults and learn the truth behind his family‚Äôs 12-year-old death.</p><p>Shinra and his team look into other fire brigades to solve the blazing enigma and free humanity from this curse but instead get caught up in the chaos of power, corruption, and manipulation.</p><p>In the Season 2 conclusion, pandemonium reigns supreme as invaders have taken control of Tokyo, and it is on fire. Additionally, Captain Hague of Special Fire Force Company 4 passed away.</p><p>Shinra, attempting to develop hysterical strength, has visions of Adolla and witnesses the captain‚Äôs dying moments.</p><p>He and Company 8 are anticipated to spend most of Season 3 forging alliances in and around Tokyo to support them as they engage in combat with the White Clad and the Evangelist.</p><h2 id=Fire_Force_Season_3_News>Fire Force Season 3 News</h2><p>Due to its success, Fire Force was made into an anime, a drama, a stage production, and even a computer game.</p><p>It‚Äôs not surprising given that, as of May 2022, the manga had sold over 20 million copies globally. It was even nominated in the Shonen category of the 45th Kodansha Manga Award in 2021.</p><p>On February 22, 2022, the manga‚Äôs final chapter was regrettably published. This has led to speculation among fans that this may be the last season of the Fire Force anime.</p><p>The anime has already covered the first 20 volumes or the first 174 chapters of the manga.</p><p>Volumes 1 through 11 were covered in Season 1, while Volumes 11 through 20 were covered in Season 2. Books 21 through 34 are likely to be covered in the upcoming season.</p><p>The same studio that provided the first two seasons of Fire Force, David Productions, also credited with producing JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure and Cells at Work, will bring the anime‚Äôs third season.</p><p>The animation director from Season 2, Tatsuma Minamikawa, who took over from Yuki Yase, might return for the third season.</p><p>Whether it ends with this season or not, we are undoubtedly anticipating Fire Force‚Äôs future comeback!
