<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although the actor has bagged more than a few accolades for his role in the medical drama, there was one time that the drama in the series hit so close to home that his wife had to intervene and get the storyline altered.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Maurice Bernard's Wife Had To Step In</h2><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Smashing Interviews Magazine</a>, Bernard recalled how his wife, Paula, had to call the producers of General Hospital and tell them to cut his character's bi-polar storyline short because it had gone on for too long.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For those of you unaware, the actor was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 22 years old and had since taken up the responsibility to use his platform to speak up for those suffering from the same illness. He is also a&nbsp;spokesperson for the treatment of the disorder with Mental Health America.&nbsp;</p><p>Bernard lives in a family of six with&nbsp;his wife, Paula, and their four children in their California residence. The couple shares two daughters and a son who has already taken after his father to pursue acting.&nbsp;</p><h2>Maurice Bernard Felt the Bipolar Arc Was Too Long</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Going back to General Hospital, the series narrated a storyline where Bernard's character and his father both had bipolar disorder. Bernard admitted that the arc was especially emotional for him because of how much it resonated with his own life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, things went on to the point that playing the part started becoming difficult for the actor because of how stretched out the arc was.&nbsp;</p><p>"Then my wife had to call&nbsp;General Hospital&nbsp;and say, 'Cut it,'" he explained.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He also revealed that once when he was on the sets of the medical drama, he heard his mom and dad talking, when in fact, they weren't even there. That's when he decided that the arc needed to end.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>People Should Take Mental Health More Seriously</h2><p>But he admitted that the hallucinations weren't the worst&nbsp;part of having bipolar disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think the worst part is either depression and maybe anxiety that happens," he explained, "and your mind can’t stop racing."&nbsp;</p><p>For a brief while, he also touched on how the stigma surrounding mental health had subdued, to a certain extent. However, he argued that despite the stigmatization going down, people were yet to take mental health as seriously as it should be taken.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Mental Health Issues Run in the Family</h2><p>The actor also expounded on how the mental disorder runs in the family because it was&nbsp;hereditary. It could be from either one's mother's or father's side of the family.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the actor, he suspected that he inherited the condition from his mother. Growing up. Bernard had his doubts, but his mother had never brought up the subject&nbsp;until sometime in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, she agreed to visit a psychiatrist. Although the actor was not sure about her diagnosis, he was delighted by the fact that his mother told him that she didn't want to feel "this way" anymore.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRqr%2Bqr8RmmZ6mkaexbsPIn5xnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./photos-anime-oasis-convention-in-downtown-boise.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Photos: Anime Oasis convention in downtown Boise</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hollywood-s-rising-star-s-journey-net-worth-and-private-life-in-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hollywood's Rising Star's Journey, Net Worth, and Private Life in 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
