The two youngsters looked all grown-up in the shot, appearing as tall as their dad.</p><p class=dh>Via Instagram, actor and comedian Kevin Hart showed off his kids posing alongside him during a family outing. The shot, taken by Hart’s wife, showed the father of four, standing in front of a wall, flanked by his two children Heaven Hart and Hendrix Hart.</p><p class=dh>Kevin looked formal in an all-black ensemble comprising a two-piece suit and a pair of shoes, with a pair of sunshades. To his right, Heaven posed in a green halter-neck mini gown, paired with black high-heeled sandals and a matching purse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d222957c6cbded50c174c46c3c50d4cc.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kevin Hart at the "Jumanji: The Next Level" premiere on December 09, 2019, in Hollywood, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The 16-year old’s beautiful smile made her appear more adorable. Hendrix stood at Kevin’s right, crossing his arms in front of him, with his head held high.</p><p class=dh>The thirteen-year-old looked almost a head taller than his dad in his white shirt and matching kicks. Captioning the post, the star <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CTdCZrWBwWC/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>“Squad… My everything’s #Hart… Wifey gets the photo credit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f55df01cd1b115919392179a532e733c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Torrei Hart on October 30, 2018 in Universal City, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The picture left fans gushing about the beautiful family and how much the kids have grown over the years. Others commended the entertainer for being an amazing dad to his kids.</p><p class=dh>The “Fatherhood” star has indeed been the best father to his four children, instilling in them commendable attributes that would make them grow into exemplary adults.</p><p class=dh>Back in July, the star made headlines when he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/kevin-hart-teaches-daughter-heaven-16-to-drive-my-little-girl-is-growing-up/>revealed</a> on Instagram that he was teaching his oldest daughter, Heaven, to drive. He included a photo of the two of them hitting the road with the teenager behind the wheels.</p><p class=dh>The comedian also strives to teach the children humility, self-discipline, and financial awareness. Kevin’s “Fatherhood” co-star, Alfre Woodard once spoke fondly of the actor’s parenting tactic, especially his willingness to let his kids handle tasks he could have easily assigned to someone else.</p><p class=dh>The approach has admittedly left the children grounded and humble, despite their privileged backgrounds, and live in the spotlight. Kevin’s goal was to ensure the youngster grew up knowing they could surmount any challenge.</p><p class=dh>Another approach to fatherhood the star has adopted is the art of talking and listening to his kids. He once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.romper.com/entertainment/kevin-hart-interview-fatherhood>explained</a>:</p><p class=dh>“What I’ve learned as a father is that the most important thing in the world is listening. It’s not about trying to be right. [...] It’s about listening, understanding.”</p><p class=dh>In the end, what was important was equipping the kids with the best information to make the best decisions for themselves. And that’s where talking comes to play.</p><p class=dh>Kevin stressed the importance of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://parade.com/1224270/jessicasager/kevin-hart-kids/>talking</a> to kids about everything, including family scandals one might be tempted to sweep under the carpet.</p><p class=dh>The proud dad admitted he already spoke to his two oldest about his Las Vegas cheating scandal. Letting the kids <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.romper.com/entertainment/kevin-hart-interview-fatherhood>find out</a> from him that he cheated on his wife while she was pregnant was better than having them find out on the internet.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Kevin</a> applies the principles to all four of his kids, making his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/kevin-harts-kids-meet-his-children-and-blended-family/vin-hart-kids/>blended family</a> a mini heaven. The actor's family comprises daughter, Heaven, and son, Hendrix, from his first marriage to Torrei Hart, whom he divorced in 2010, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p class=dh>His second wife, Eniko Parrish bore him a son, Kenzo Kash, and daughter Kaori-Mai, aged three years and 11 months respectively. Despite having different moms, the Hart quad is united in love and harmony, proving themselves the ultimate blended family goals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtucWpnbnqssdWipWagkafBtHnEpZueql2gtqW%2FjLCfqKVdnbJuwMClop6cXZ22b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rashod-kent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rashod Kent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessie-mei-li.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessie Mei-Li</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
