He is not entirely pleased to know that Mitch has feelings for his sister Candace (Tika Sumpter), and is constantly gnashing his teeth at the two of them. It's surprising that Benny is trying to take the upper hand here, considering that he slept with a woman like Veronica Harrington (Angela Robinson), who is almost capable of murdering someone.</p><p>Fans are sniggering at Benny's attitude and are wondering what would he exactly do if Mitch and Candace do get together. "How Benny questioning anyone, when he slept with Veronica??? #HAHN," one fan asked.&nbsp; Viewers found it rather hilarious that Candace hit back and called him slow. "Thank you Candace for saying Benny's slow! We've all been saying that and now she questioning him #HAHN," one wrote. "Benny's got a lot of nerve questioning someone else, when he laid down with Veronica. #HAHN," another wrote.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Benny's got a lot of nerve questioning someone else, when he laid down with Veronica. <a href=#>#HAHN</a></p>— Remond Robinson (@sgimi323) <a href=#>December 23, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>How Benny questioning anyone, when he slept with Veronica???<a href=#>#HAHN</a></p>— MzShamar (@mzshamar23) <a href=#>December 23, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Candace's pregnancy is still a mystery and there is much debate on whether she is going to take the test or not. Charles is still in the picture and he is still moping about her. In the previous episode, Landon tried questioning Candace about her pregnancy, and she booted him right out of the door. So... is she pregnant or not? When will that mystery be solved?</p><p>In the previous season, Candace met the man, Derrick, who raped her mother, Hanna. Benny found out about Derrick and almost beat him to a puddle, but Hanna told him to stay out of it. Speaking of Hanna, she's nothing less than a boss woman this season, as she has managed to own Jim Cryer (John Schneider) and David Harrington (Peter Parros) quite a few times. Jim has tried being racist to her, and she's shown him his place. She even hit out at David with a candlestick for trying to be one step ahead of her. Hanna is truly the new ice queen, so goodbye Veronica?</p><p>'The Haves And The Have Nots' airs on Tuesdays at 8 pm on OWN.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaeqmt1Z6qZpmemXq1tMRmn5qulWK7sMDSZqqemaOku26EjJ6noqufmbJugYybnKemqWLDpr7Op6CcmV2brq950Z6YnKyZpLu0ecyiq5ygXZiur7DAnJw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alan-eisenberg-obituary-executive-director-of-the-actors-equity-association-has-sadly-passed-awa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alan Eisenberg Obituary, Executive Director Of The Actors Equity Association Has Sadly Passed Awa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-orton-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Randy Orton Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
