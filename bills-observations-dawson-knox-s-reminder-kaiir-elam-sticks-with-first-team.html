The team returns to Buffalo for a Friday night practice at Highmark Stadium: the blue and red scrimmage.</p><p>But first, the Bills completed another day of work at St. John Fisher University and saw the return of three previous non-participants from Day 6. Defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=zMYnriWVJvQxaX1g href=#>Tim Settle</a> and cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=A4nqu4X5VzylRtm4 href=#>Kyron Brown</a>, who had been dealing with groin injuries, got back on the field Thursday. As did safety <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WpZKWArS36a5jGeu href=#>Jordan Poyer</a>, though he only sat out Day 6 on a veteran rest day.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>What stood out on Day 7, and how are some of the competitions shifting now quite far into camp? Here are several observations from Thursday’s session:</p><h2>Elam gets more first-team time</h2><p>For the second practice in a row, the reps with the first-team defense mostly belonged to second-year cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=JJbflEYt54YCFK0u href=#>Kaiir Elam</a>.</p><p>Elam started training camp on the outside looking in of the first-team defense through the first three practices, but he has been a mainstay — at least getting some reps — since Day 4. It’s notable that he took as many first-team reps as he did on Thursday, because that marked two straight days of him essentially being the top guy on the field with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2AJ6oTJrxGnx7gDh href=#>Tre’Davious White</a>. It also marks four consecutive sessions that the Bills worked him into the first-team defense, while <a class=ath_autolink data-id=j0maTHM8YBIPSMBQ href=#>Christian Benford</a> has only done so once out of the last four practices. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZB4Fl2ADVvPTSjqC href=#>Dane Jackson</a> has gotten time with the top unit three of the first four days, but the last two mostly have been Elam, who ended the practice with an interception. There is some context behind it, though.</p><p>The Bills were working on fourth-and-long in that period, so there was no real threat to run, and Elam had a firm grasp of the intended receiver, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Y4vxTiWypP0cpuZ2 href=#>Trent Sherfield</a>, before jumping the route. Quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9zLTUSPpy6pFa4xs href=#>Josh Allen</a> and offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey motioned for defensive holding to be called, and Allen even said after practice that Elam got away with one. Regardless, it wasn’t called by the referees in attendance, so it counts. And it also counts for continuing his confidence amidst a competition that appears to be trending positively for him.</p><p>Considering the investment in him, the last two practices could be a pivotal point in the trajectory for Elam’s second season. Although how Elam performs in preseason games is a huge piece to the puzzle, the coaching staff’s action by giving him additional first-team opportunities on consecutive days is a good sign. The rotation in the upcoming practices bears watching because if it continues in Elam’s way leading up to the first preseason game, it could wind up being his job to lose. But it’s not over by any stretch, and it was still legitimately up for grabs from the spring into the early practices of the summer.</p><ul><li>Keep up with all things from 2023 Bills training camp <a href=#>here</a>.</li></ul><p>When the Bills opened up their camp, the middle linebacker competition featured three players: <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZxgTwYMjUwbrPqXE href=#>Tyrel Dodson</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Bgkdhz03M4GzlbZk href=#>Terrel Bernard</a> and Baylon Spector. Each got their day next to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZRj4di17FE6yBxBv href=#>Matt Milano</a> with the first-team defense over the first three practices. Even without a padded practice on the top unit, that one day might be all that Spector gets. On Day 6, the Bills had Dodson as the middle linebacker next to Milano, effectively skipping Spector’s expected spot in the daily rotation. And again on Day 7, it was not Spector, but Bernard with the top unit instead. When asked why Dodson skipped Spector’s turn, coach Sean McDermott said they’ve liked the job Spector has done but wanted to focus in on Dodson and Bernard. With so few reps and camp already on the back half, that answer is as good of an indication as any that they’ve made at least one decision.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>That also applies to third-round rookie linebacker <a class=ath_autolink data-id=dDpa7XyFhrrHukS6 href=#>Dorian Williams</a>, who has yet to receive any first-team time at middle linebacker. McDermott said Thursday they’ve been focusing exclusively on Williams playing outside linebacker within their scheme after trying him out in the middle in the spring. Without time on task, that effectively rules him out of the competition at middle linebacker. So if the Spector and Williams bits of information remain true, either Dodson or Bernard will start next to Milano against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=52 href=#>Jets</a> in Week 1.</p><h2>Day 7 was a <a class=ath_autolink data-id=FE6Y1HgdRshAoBXt href=#>Dawson Knox</a> involvement reminder</h2><p>It’s easy to get wrapped up in the training camp of a rookie player, especially one who was picked as highly as tight end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=uhpF8rWM5PhxEUD1 href=#>Dalton Kincaid</a>. Throughout camp, Kincaid has consistently played well as a pass-catcher, teasing what could be a substantial involvement in the offense in 2023. Even during Day 7, Kincaid caught three of Allen’s 10 attempts during practice. However, starting tight end Dawson Knox had possibly his best day of training camp so far, with the highlight being a touchdown catch on the first 11-on-11 play of the practice.</p><p>Knox was working against the linebacker Bernard from the inside to the outside, breaking free with ample separation toward the front right corner of the end zone. Allen put the throw on target, and Knox brought in the over-the-shoulder reception for a touchdown. He also had some other involvement in the offensive attack the rest of the way, which further underscores that if Kincaid gets a good amount of snaps this season, it will not happen because he’s replacing Knox in the lineup, barring an injury. Knox is still a big part of their offensive plan in 2023, and having the two on the field together could be one of their most heavily used personnel packages in 2023.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Bills observations: More dazzling from Dalton Kincaid, possible clarity on MLB rotation</p></a><p>For the most part in the first seven practices, 2023 free agent acquisition <a class=ath_autolink data-id=oRAhJJELvqRozWVu href=#>Connor McGovern</a> has been taking the first-team reps at left guard. Outside of drafting Kincaid, the McGovern contract was their most substantial offseason investment, and to this point, the returns have been relatively positive. But on a handful of series over the last few days, McGovern has ceded some first-team reps to another free agent signing, David Edwards. It’s been a very good camp to this point for Edwards, both in team drills and in one-on-one and two-on-two opportunities. Before an injury-riddled 2022, he was a locked-in starter for the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=59 href=#>Rams</a> for three years.</p><p>On top of that, Edwards also has prior experience with Bills offensive line coach Aaron Kromer while in Los Angeles, so there’s a level of trust there in Edwards. This seems like it could be just the Bills wanting to familiarize left tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1Z8oWXcTMIFRAxyr href=#>Dion Dawkins</a> and center <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nq5kcvnBBtVLXMXj href=#>Mitch Morse</a> with Edwards in the event of an injury to McGovern, but there’s no ignoring Edwards’ performance to this point. It will be something to track to see if those first-team opportunities become a bit more frequent for Edwards. At worst, Edwards appears to be a massive upgrade to what the Bills had as a reserve offensive lineman in 2022.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Epenesa challenging for a lot of snaps without Miller available</h2><p>As <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3CFHRgYPasw0E3hK href=#>Von Miller</a> <a href=#>continues his rehab from a late-November torn ACL</a>, most of the attention on the defensive ends has been on third-year player <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DA37tJCuXdEPpwnT href=#>Greg Rousseau</a> and free agent acquisition <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8Itq1mLAmeamKQM5 href=#>Leonard Floyd</a>. Rousseau remains an unquestioned starter, and based on what he showed before a high ankle sprain last season, he has the potential to have a breakout season in 2023. Floyd should factor in quite a bit as well, though it’s a slightly imperfect fit because Rousseau and Floyd are at their best rushing from the defensive left side.</p><p>They have certainly taken plenty of reps together throughout camp, but the left-sided proclivity for each player has allowed <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Vy3ID5vQnnaHArmI href=#>A.J. Epenesa</a> to get a steady stream of first-team time every day on the defensive right side. Although not quite as impactful as his camp in 2022, Epenesa has shown some good pass rushing and run defending in spots so far this camp. Perhaps most telling, he’s consistently playing ahead of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=VikCWtqzSU01cjfV href=#>Shaq Lawson</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=IVufHPnCSzZ4tRXu href=#>Boogie Basham</a>, as they appear to be on the outside looking in on the top four pass rushers (including Miller). Epenesa’s involvement and solid showings could pave the way for a substantial role until Miller is ready enough to play this season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re live with Josh Allen after practice at training camp.<a href=#>#BillsCamp</a> | <a href=#>#BillsMafia</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/WThoBOqDhR</a></p><p>— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=#>August 3, 2023</a></p><h2>A day of highs and lows for Josh Allen</h2><p>The first-team passing offense was full of highlights Thursday, though some of them were for their passing prowess and others were turnovers. Allen finished the practice completing 10 of 16 passes for two touchdowns, though with two turnovers and a fumble mixed in. The first interception was Allen’s fault entirely, as he rolled left and didn’t put enough on the pass to the sideline, allowing Dane Jackson to intercept the throw well behind the intended receiver. The second interception to Elam was less of Allen’s fault, and more a victim of the fourth-down circumstances and trying to make a play, but it remains on his ledger regardless. The fumble was Allen’s fault, as a slightly higher shotgun snap went through of the quarterback’s hands and looped five-plus yards behind him. That’s a snap Allen has consistently received without problem, so it’s just something else to fine-tune.</p><p>However, when Allen was on, he was locked into his targets, allowing them the accuracy, momentum and space to get the ball up the field for additional yardage. His touchdown toss to Knox to begin the day was perfect, as was another scoring throw to receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=r6EKVq5tIsdjEGad href=#>Gabe Davis</a>. Considering two of his big errors were his fault, Allen has had the tendency of coming through with a big performance on his next day of work. It wouldn’t be a surprise if Allen has one of his best days at Highmark Stadium on Friday night because of it.</p><h2>Isabella pops on second- and third-team work</h2><p>For an addition in the middle of training camp, wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Zqut4vxPmMVA770o href=#>Andy Isabella</a> has looked pretty good so far while trying to learn a new playbook on the fly. Isabella, who has worked primarily at slot receiver <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">since his arrival to the Bills</a>, has seen his opportunities slowly increase during team drills. He shows some real talent as an intermediate, middle-of-the-field route runner. On Thursday, Isabella worked in with the second- and third-team offenses, and brought in one touchdown pass, and two other receptions to quietly make his mark.</p><p>The 5-foot-9 Isabella was a 2019 second-round pick and is trying to keep his career alive, but he’s done a nice job so far. Considering <a class=ath_autolink data-id=AUksgZov8jpvh7HT href=#>Khalil Shakir</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ukF8L13ujWc3h2Oh href=#>Deonte Harty</a> have their roster spots locked in, and with fellow slot receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=W9CjNczem32tRh01 href=#>Bryan Thompson</a> sidelined with a concussion, Isabella has the chance to be a heavy contributor in their preseason games. Isabella remains a roster longshot, but if he does well enough with the opportunity, a practice squad invitation in 2023 is definitely within his reach.</p><p><strong>Day 7 non-participants:</strong> WR <a class=ath_autolink data-id=xMaJw46kLS2eJKGt href=#>Isaiah Coulter</a> (knee), WR Bryan Thompson (knee), DE Von Miller (knee, PUP list), DT <a class=ath_autolink data-id=c8SuUOg5YQcWICH7 href=#>Jordan Phillips</a> (shoulder, PUP list), LB <a class=ath_autolink data-id=pIfFi6KJGEbmpAAT href=#>Tyler Matakevich</a> (calf, PUP list)</p><p>(Photo of Dawson Knox: Gregory Fisher / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3Brb3FhbnxzfJFsZmlwX2WAcK7Un52apJ9ir6q4y6xkraqRnruqusZmmpqloGKDcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-whitfield-age-net-worth-wife-bio-wiki-kids-weight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Whitfield Age, Net worth: Wife, Bio-Wiki, Kids, Weight</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-timothy-brown-5-things-about-nfl-player-actor-dead-at-82-hollywood-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Timothy Brown? 5 Things About NFL Player &amp;amp; Actor Dead At 82 Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
