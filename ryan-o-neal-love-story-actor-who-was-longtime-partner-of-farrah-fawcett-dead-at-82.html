He was 82.</p><p>His son, 56-year-old actor&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;O’Neal, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the news on his Instagram account</a> Friday.</p><p>“So this is the toughest thing I’ve ever had to say but here we go. My dad passed away peacefully today, with his loving team by his side supporting him and loving him as he would us,” he wrote.</p><p>“My father Ryan O’Neal has always been my hero. I looked up to him and he was always bigger than life,” he continued. “As a human being, my father was as generous as they come. And the funniest person in any room. And the most handsome clearly, but also the most charming. Lethal combo. He loved to make people laugh. It’s pretty much his goal. Didn’t matter the situation, if there was a joke to be found, he nailed it. He really wanted us laughing. And we did all laugh. Every time. We had fun. Fun in the sun.”</p><p>“As my father, he was second to none. The best and most loving and supportive dad, and I am just so lucky to have had him,” he continued. “We loved playing/watching sports together. Some great frisbee throws on the beach that would last all weekend long. For years. That was our bond.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">O’Neal became a household name when he starred in 1970’s “Love Story” opposite Ali MacGraw.

He initially stated it was Stage 4 cancer before later clarifying it was Stage 2. He underwent <a href=#>back surgery</a> in 2017 and famously suffered from alcoholism and drug abuse over the years. His cause of death is still unknown.</p><p>The Post has reached out to O’Neal’s rep for comment.</p><p>Born Charles Patrick Ryan O’Neal in LA on April 20, 1941, O’Neal was the son of actress Patricia Ruth Olga&nbsp;and novelist/screenwriter&nbsp;Charles O’Neal.</p><p>Before he got into acting, O’Neal trained to become a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">professional boxer</a>, competing in two Golden Gloves championships in LA in the 1950s. His amateur fighting record is 18 wins to four losses, with 13 knockouts.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ryan O’Neal gave a knockout performance with Barbra Streisand in 1979’s “The Main Event.” <span class=credit>©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>His family moved to Germany for his dad’s job when O’Neal was in high school. He struggled at his new&nbsp;Munich school, so he became an extra and stuntman on a local show, sparking his interest in acting.</p><p>O’Neal returned to the States to pursue performing and landed several roles on TV shows, including “The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,” “The Untouchables,” “Leave It To Beaver” and “The Virginian.” He regularly appeared on NBC’s Western series “Empire” from&nbsp;1962 to 1963.</p><p>His first big acting break came in 1964 as Rodney Harrington in the TV drama “Peyton Place.” That led to several movie credits, including his first leading film role in 1969’s “The Big Bounce.”</p><p>O’Neal became a household name when he starred in 1970’s “Love Story” opposite Ali MacGraw.

May he rest in peace.”</p><p>His other notable works include “Paper Moon,” “Barry Lyndon,”&nbsp;“A Bridge Too Far”&nbsp;and “The Main Event.”</p><p>O’Neal’s final TV appearances came on 24 episodes of “Bones,” ending in 2017. He and his only daughter, Tatum O’Neal, also invited cameras to watch as they tried to repair their father/daughter relationship on “Ryan and Tatum: The O’Neals” in 2011.</p><p>His final film, a horror movie titled “The Waste Lands,” is in development, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.</p><p>O’Neal was also well-known for his high-profile romances. He was married to Joanna Moore from 1963 to 1967. They had two children: Tatum&nbsp;and&nbsp;Griffin. He wed Leigh-Taylor Young in 1967, and they had a son, Patrick. The couple divorced in 1971.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Tatum O’Neal sits with father Ryan O’Neal at a screening in Hollywood in 1973. <span class=credit>Mediapunch/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>He and Farrah Fawcett, meanwhile, famously had a tumultuous on-and-off relationship, first from 1979 to 1997, and then from 2001 until<a href=#> her death</a> in 2009. They had one son together, Redmond, now 35, in 1985. They never married.</p><p>The relationship between O’Neal and the “Charlie’s Angels” actress was reportedly ruined by his infidelity and hot temper. The couple called it quits the first time after Fawcett found O’Neal in bed with actress Leslie Stefanson.</p><p>“I got married at 21, and I was not a real mature 21,” O’Neal told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> in 2009 about his cheating ways. “My first child was born when I was 22. I was a man’s man; I didn’t discover women until I was married, and then it was too late.”</p><p>The late actor often made headlines for his troubled relationship with Fawcett and his estrangement from his children.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ryan O’Neal and Farrah Fawcett famously had a tumultuous on-and-off relationship, first from 1979 to 1997, and then from 2001 until her death in 2009. <span class=credit>DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>His drug abuse caused a rift from his three oldest kids for several years. Tatum and Griffin have spoken about how O’Neal’s struggles affected their family, and Griffin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even claimed</a> that his dad gave him cocaine when he was 11 and “insisted” he take it.</p><p>“He was a very abusive, narcissistic psychopath. He gets so mad he can’t control anything he’s doing,” Griffin added in Vanity Fair.</p><p>“I’m a hopeless father. I don’t know why,” O’Neal admitted to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the mag</a> in 2009. “I don’t think I was supposed to be a father. Just look around at my work — they’re either in jail or they should be.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O’Neal attend the 1989 New York premiere of “Chances Are.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I have nice <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grandchildren</a>, though,” he added.</p><p>O’Neal was arrested in 2007 for shooting at Griffin, which he claimed was self-defense. The charges were dropped, but O’Neal still refused to let Griffin attend Fawcett’s 2009 funeral after she died on June 25, 2009, at age 62 of anal cancer.</p><p>“I came from a not-so-nice kind of a world,” Griffin said of Fawcett on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Larry King Live”</a> that same year. “We were a kind of a battling and kind of crazy family.

But she took a turn for the worse. This was just a few weeks before the end, so perhaps it wasn’t realistic. The two of them had a deep bond and deep love. No matter what they went through, the ups and downs, he was the one she wanted by her side.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ryan O’Neal speaks during the American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards 2013 held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2013, in Beverly Hills, Calif. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>O’Neal famously hit on Tatum by accident at the funeral.</p><p>“I had just put the casket in the hearse and I was watching it drive away when a beautiful blonde woman comes up and embraces me … I said to her, ‘You have a drink on you? You have a car?’ She said ‘Daddy, it’s me — Tatum!’ I was just trying to be funny with a strange Swedish woman, and it’s my daughter. It’s so sick,” O’Neal recalled to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>.</p><p>“That’s our relationship in a nutshell,” Tatum explained to the publication. “You make of it what you will.

I suffered years of abuse, both emotional and sexual,” she said of O’Neal and Moore.</p><p>O’Neal and Redmond, meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were arrested</a> for possession of what authorities believed to be methamphetamine at the actor’s Malibu home in 2008.
