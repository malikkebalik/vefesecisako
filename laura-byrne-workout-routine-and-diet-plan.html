We can’t blame them given the fact that we were also mesmerized by her two-piece get-up and couldn’t get enough of it.</p><p>[toc]</p><p>If you were also stunned by her looks, then we suggest you have a look at her workout routine and diet plan that were recently unveiled by none other than her trainer Jono Castano Acero.</p><figure id=attachment_100275 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-100275 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Laura Byrne with Matthew David Johnson in January 2018 (Laura Byrne / Instagram)</figure><h2><strong>Laura Byrne 2018 Workout Routine and Diet Plan</strong></h2><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><p>The trainer designs her workout sessions every week, and they train for 4 days a week due to her busy schedule. The timespan of each session is just 45 minutes and this time frame is enough to help the diva reach her fitness goals. One of the exercise methods that they stick to is High-Intensity Interval Training or <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>HIIT</a> as they do it twice a week. On the rest of the days, they focus on building muscles of abs and legs.</p><h3><strong>Workout for the Logie Awards</strong></h3><p>For the Australian Logie awards, the trainer amped up the workout routine of the star about 6 weeks before. He added an extra workout session every week and customized Acero Training Series for her needs so that she could identify each goal and meet the same. They did 45-minute sessions for 5 days out of which 2 days were dedicated to the core, 2 were reserved for legs and 1 day was for HIIT.</p><figure id=attachment_100276 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-100276 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Laura Byrne in a selfie while on her way to VAMFF in March 2018 (Laura Byrne / Instagram)</figure><h3><strong>Building the Booty</strong></h3><p>As Laura and her boyfriend Matty Johnson live in Bondy, they are often seen at the beach baring it all. If you are impressed by her pert booty, then you should know that she works hard to achieve that. 2 exercises that her trainer recommends for building the posterior are <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>squats</a> and hip thrusts.</p><h3><strong>Diet Plan</strong></h3><p>Apart from working hard in the gym, another secret that helps Byrne look so ravishing is that she follows the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ketogenic diet</a>. Her diet plan includes having 5 meals a day. A breakfast, a mid-morning meal, lunch, a mid-afternoon meal, and dinner.</p><p>All the meals include animal proteins and healthy vegetables like spinach, broccoli and Brussel sprouts. She also likes eating low carbohydrate fruits like berries, avocado, lime, lemon, nuts, seeds, oils, fats, and high-fat dairy.</p><p>Featured Image by Laura Byrne / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqWYrqqRYq%2B6vs2eZLCnoqC8tsCMq6aurJmjsm6tzZ1knaGVqXqxuMCnZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leann-rimes-wiki-bio-age-married-husband-career-net-worth-songs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LeAnn Rimes Wiki-Bio, Age, Married, Husband, Career, Net Worth, Songs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kota-factory-season-3-official-netflix-release-date-cast-plot-and-more-updates.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kota Factory Season 3 Official Netflix Release Date, Cast, Plot, And More Updates</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
