David Harbour, John Leguizamo, Cam Gigandet, Alex Hassell, Alexis Louder, Edi Patterson, and Beverly D’Angelo star in the film.</p><h2>Violent Night Release Date</h2><p>The film “Violent Night” will be released in theatres on December 2. There is no set streaming date, but because it is Universal, you can expect it to appear on Peacock sometime after its initial release.</p><h2>Violent Night Plot</h2><p>Violent Night is a gritty, action-packed retelling of the mythical legend of Santa Claus. As the title suggests, this isn’t your typical, holly, jolly Christmas story, but it is a Christmas story nonetheless. It’s Christmas Eve, and Santa is on his way to fulfil his annual obligation of delivering gifts to those on his nice list. But he had no idea that his work would be disrupted by a gang of goons, who would ruin his perfectly planned night. When he arrives at the home of a little girl on that list, he is surrounded by villainous people wielding weapons and is attacked.</p><p>First and foremost, all he wants to do is quietly escape and get on with his night, but the attackers won’t let him. So Santa reveals a side of himself that you have never seen or imagined before. The mercenaries in question are holding the house and its occupants hostage in exchange for a large sum of money.</p><p>What they don’t realise is that their violent act will be repaid in full, as Father Christmas confronts them with all of his magical powers, tearing them down one by one. Though the brightest day of the year takes a dark turn, all is not lost because Santa will once again make it a very merry Christmas. Not for the bad guys, at least.</p><h2>Violent Night Cast</h2><p>The main star of Violent Night is David Harbour, who plays Father Noel. His co-stars include John Leguizamo, Beverly D’Angelo, Alex Hassell, Alexis Louder, Cam Gigandet, Edi Patterson, and André Eriksen. In Harbour’s thrilling Christmas story, Santa is not the enigmatic mythical figure that he is commonly assumed to be, but rather a very real person.</p><p>He also fights like a superhero! The “Stranger Things” star has previously appeared in a number of action thrillers, including “Quantum of Solace,” “The Green Hornet,” “Suicide Squad,” and “Hellboy” (due out in 2019), among many others in the same genre and others. Look for him in Gran Turismo, Thunderbolts, and My Dentist’s Murder Trial, for which he also serves as executive producer.</p><p>Leguizamo also plays Ben, the mercenary leader. Gertrude, the family matriarch, is played by D’Angelo. Skyler, one of Gertrude’s children, is spending Christmas with his wife and daughter at the family estate, played by Alex Hassell.</p><p>Margie Matthews, Skyler’s ex-wife, is spending the holidays at the house so that their daughter can have a good Christmas, played by Alexis Louder.</p><h2>Who is the director of Violent Night?</h2><p>Tommy Wirkola, a Norwegian-born director who has previously directed the zombie films Dead Snow and Dead Snow 2: Red vs Dead, is behind the camera for Violent Night. Wirkola’s other film credits include Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters and The Trip.</p><h2>The Violent Night Discussion on Social Media</h2><p>Spoilers for a violent night John Leguizamo will play a villain in the film. On the CinemaCon stage, Harbour stated that the upcoming film bears a striking resemblance to Die Hard.</p><p>The plot revolves around Harbour’s Santa Claus rescuing a hostage-taking family. The film has been described as a “violent action-packed comedy.”</p><p>Focus Features debuted the first trailer for the upcoming film Violent Night at CinemaCon.</p><p>Film critics predicted that Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola’s new film, The Violent Night, would become a violent cult classic.</p><p>David Harbour plays the role of a badass, ass-kicking Santa Claus in the film. David previously appeared in the Netflix hit series Stranger Things. Fans have high expectations for this upcoming Christmas action-comedy film.</p><h2>Violent Night Trailer</h2><p></p><p>Fans have been waiting for the official trailer of Violent Night for a long time, and it has finally arrived. Let us be clear: you don’t want to be on this Santa’s naughty list because he doesn’t just hand out lumps of coal to bad people. What he does instead is far more dangerous and entirely appropriate. It’s like watching the Santa version of Die Hard.</p><p>Although the trailer pretty much reveals the entire plot, the fun of the film will be watching Harbour show off all of his action skills while playing the most lovable and adorable mythical figure possible. As you can see, the title of the film accurately describes what it’s about: Santa fighting with all guns blazing and setting things on fire when he sees an innocent family being attacked. This Santa believes in instant karma. The trailer clearly shows that this action-comedy film will be packed with action and thrills, making it a delectable, decadent holiday treat!
