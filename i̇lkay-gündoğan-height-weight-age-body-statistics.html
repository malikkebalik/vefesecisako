As his game improved, he was offered another opportunity by Schalke at the age of 13 but his previous rejection had scarred him and he decided against joining them.</li><li>In 2005, he joined the youth academy of&nbsp;VfL Bochum. He eventually managed to progress through the age groups and made his professional debut with the Bochum-based club.</li><li>He moved from&nbsp;VfL Bochum to&nbsp;1. FC Nürnberg in 2009. He earned his breakthrough in the 2009-10 season as he made 22 league appearances in Bundesliga.</li><li>In his 4th league appearance, İlkay managed to record an assist in an away match against Bayern Munich. He scored his first Bundesliga goal against the same team in a match against February 2010.</li><li>In May 2011, he moved to Borussia Dortmund as the club manager <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jurgen Klopp</a> felt that he would inject dynamism in his midfield. Dortmund had paid a transfer fee of&nbsp;€4&nbsp;million.</li><li>In December 2011, he scored his first goal for Dortmund in an away match against&nbsp;SC Freiburg. They managed to win the match by 4-1.</li><li>In his debut season with Dortmund, he played in 28 league matches and helped his side claim Bundesliga title. Dortmund also managed to win DFB-Pokal trophy.</li><li>He played a key role in Dortmund‘s DFL-Supercup win over Bayern Munich in July 2013. He delivered a masterful performance while playing just behind striker <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Robert Lewandowski</a> and scored his side’s 3rd goal in the 4-2 win.</li><li>In August 2013, he suffered a back injury while on an international duty with German national side. He had to undergo surgery and couldn’t return to the playing field for almost a year.</li><li>In April 2015, it was announced that he had declined to sign a contract extension with Dortmund with his contract expiring in July 2016. However, he changed his stance and signed a contract extension in July 2015.</li><li>He moved from Dortmund to Manchester City in June 2016 as the English side agreed to pay a transfer&nbsp;fee of £20&nbsp;million for the German player. He was the first player signed by new manager Pep Guardiola.</li><li>His promising start to life at Manchester City was cut short in December 2016 as he damaged his knee ligaments in a league match against Watford. He was ruled out for the entire season. He made his return to professional action in September 2017 in a league match against Watford. It had been 9 months since he suffered the injury against the same team.</li><li>He scored his first professional goal for Manchester City in a premier league match against Bournemouth in September 2016. His side romped to a 4-0 win at&nbsp;the&nbsp;City of Manchester Stadium.</li><li>In March 2013, he scored his first goal for the German national side in a&nbsp;2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier match against&nbsp;Kazakhstan. The Germans won the match by 4-1.</li><li>In May 2018, he was caught in a scandal as he posed for a picture with controversial Turkish President Recep Erdogan during his London visit. Despite being a German citizen, he had referred to Erdogan as ‘my president’. His decision to pose with Erdogan along with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mesut Ozil</a> didn’t sit well in Germany as they felt that he was endorsing Erdogan before the elections. Erdogan’s decision to crack down on activists and journalists hadn’t gone down well in liberal Germany.</li><li>A couple of weeks after his meeting with Erdogan, he was booed by the German fans during a World Cup warm-up match against Saudi Arabia. He was also jeered by fans during World Cup matches.</li><li>Follow him on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;İlkay Gündoğan / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqKjpJmpYrS2usOonpqmXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./venessa-villanueva.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Venessa Villanueva</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ahmet-zappa-is-selma-blair-s-ex-husband-all-about-him.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ahmet Zappa Is Selma Blair's Ex-Husband: All About Him</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
