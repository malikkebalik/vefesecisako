was a contestant on season 18 of “The Bachelorette,” and the star of season 26 of “The Bachelor.” The real estate agent and former college football star was involved in a paternity lawsuit in August, when an expectant mother who believes that Echard is the father of her unborn babies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded that he take a paternity test.</a></p><p>The 33-year-old podcast host from Scottsdale, Arizona — who wishes to remain anonymous — claimed in the lawsuit, which was first <a href=#>obtained by the US Sun</a>, that she “engaged in sexual activity” with the reality TV star on May 20 in a one-night stand.&nbsp;</p><p>She claimed that she’s due to give birth to twins in February and recently filed a motion to seal the case, which has yet to be granted by the court.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The former “Bachelor” has spoken out about his paternity test mess. <span class=credit>ABC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>She also alleged that Echard was being uncooperative.&nbsp;</p><p>The unnamed woman claimed the reality TV star did not believe she was pregnant and began sending her “erratic, illogical and threatening messages.” She filed screenshots of the alleged messages in court. “I don’t believe you for a second,” read one of the alleged messages from Echard.</p><p>“I legitimately hate you right now,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">read another</a>.&nbsp;“You have lost your mind and I hope YOU think about how terrible this is that you would subject me to this” and “My personal hell would be having to have you be a part of my life,” read other alleged messages.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clayton Echard is saying that the truth shall “set him free.” <span class=credit>Sara Jaye Weiss/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>Now, Echard is speaking out, and claiming that “the truth will set [him] free.”</p><p>The former “Bachelor” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a screenshot of a receipt to his Instagram story</a> on Thursday, showing he allegedly made a $725 payment on Sept. 21 for a paternity test.</p><p>He also shared an e-mail, reading, “Thanks for the call. My confusion has been cleared up. I will take my portion of the test on the 27th of September.”</p><p>“[Redacted] will take her portion on the 2nd of October,” he wrote. “Results will then take about a week to get back. I believe we’re all on the same page now.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clayton Echard’s time on “The Bachelor” was dramatic, he chose Susie Evans after sending her home. <span class=credit>ABC via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clayton Echard is no longer dating Susie Evans, who he chose at the end of his time on “The Bachelor.” <span class=credit>ABC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Echard’s time on “The Bachelor” was controversial. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately chose Susie Evans</a>, but before that, he sent her home and was intimate with other women.&nbsp;</p><p>In the dramatic finale, Echard decided not to give the final rose to either of&nbsp; the remaining two women – Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia – and pursued Evans.&nbsp;</p><p>Echard and Evans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced their breakup</a> in September 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>In another slide <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on his Instagram Story </a>on Thursday, Echard claimed, “I’ve been notified (and have confirmed) that there are other individuals out there with nearly identical accusations being made against them by the exact same person. Some of the court cases are still publicly accessible and active.”</p><p>The unnamed woman and Echard are both due in court for an early resolution conference on Sept. 28.</p><p>On Oct. 6, Echard announced that he is in the clear. “Listen, it’s Friday and you know what we need on a Friday? We need some good news and who has got the good news today? I got the good news today,” Echard, 30, said&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram video</a>&nbsp;on Friday, October 6. “The test results came back early and they said little to no fetal DNA present. Let’s go baby! I knew that was going to happen and thankfully five months of torture can finally be put to rest.”</p><p>He continued: “Two false accusations in two years — I really don’t want to look ahead to next year to see what will happen. I think two false accusations in a lifetime is enough. Thank you all for the support and love. This has been a trying time but I learned so much about myself and now back to the regularly scheduled program.”</p><p>In addition to the paternity mess, Echard is referring to rumors that he in 2022 he cheated on then-girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Susie Evans</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2pfl66ktMSlpqtlkaHCrnnCpZiyrJ%2Bjeqavx5qpnatdpa61sdGnoK2xXamytMCMppysq12staLAjK2mZqOepMRw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-tj-hunt-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All About TJ Hunt | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-barry-keoghan-find-out-if-the-actor-is-gay-or-straight-the-talks-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Barry Keoghan?
