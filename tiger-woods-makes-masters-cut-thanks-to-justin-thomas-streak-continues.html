Justin Thomas, one of his best friends, struggled on his way home behind Woods and helped move the cutline to 3-over par from 2-over, allowing Woods to not only make it to the final 36 holes but tie the tournament record for most consecutive cuts made at 23 in a row.</p><p>Woods, who’s never missed a Masters cut as a professional, tied his good friend Fred Couples and Gary Player <a href=#>with the 23 consecutive cuts.</a></p><p><strong>“</strong>I’ve always loved this golf course, and I love playing this event,’’ Woods said before knowing he has clinched a spot in the third round. “Obviously, I’ve missed a couple [cuts] with some injuries, but I’ve always wanted to play here. I’ve loved it. I got a chance to play [the weekend].’’</p><p>Woods, who was on the 12th&nbsp;tee when second-round play was suspended due to dangerous weather on Friday, began the day perfectly when he stuffed his shot onto the 12th&nbsp;green, about four feet from the hole.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tiger Woods narrowly made the cut at the Masters. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>But Woods, who was 2-over at the time, pulled the putt and missed it.</p><p>“At 12 … it was a good shot, it was 145 (yards),’’ Woods said. “We knew the number. Joe (LaCava, his caddie) went up and got it yesterday, which was good. We hit it a few times on the range and felt comfortable over it. I hit a good shot. Then I hit just a terrible putt. I pulled it.’’</p><p>He birdied the par-5 15th&nbsp;hole to get to 1-over and give himself some cushion, but Woods gave that cushion back with bogeys on 17 and 18.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Justin Thomas reacts after missing the Masters cut. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“On 15, at least it didn’t go in the water this time when it hit the flag,’’ Woods said, referring to the 2013 Masters when he hit the flag stick on 15, like he did Saturday. “So that was nice. Made a good putt there and then just didn’t finish very well.’’</p><p>Once the cut was made, the third round began at 11:30 a.m. Saturday and the players went off in threesomes off the first and 10th holes.&nbsp;</p><p>The 47-year-old Woods, a five-time Masters champion, was paired with Thomas Pieters and Sungjae Im in the final group off the 10th&nbsp;tee.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tiger Woods making the cut at the Masters was far from a given after his bogey on No. 18 <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Brooks Koepka (12-under) entered the third round as the leader over Jon Rahm (10-under). Amateur Sam Bennett is alone in third at 8-under, followed by&nbsp;Collin Morikawa&nbsp;and&nbsp;Viktor Hovland&nbsp;at 6-under.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21maXBfqbaosdFmrqinlKh6rq3KnqpmpZGowaa%2B0maarqxdqbWiusqsZK2nXZ%2FCtMDIp2StoJ%2BirrR50q2pnpmbYrCwutOipa6do2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./youtuber-hayley-leblanc-earns-quite-a-revenue-from-her-youtube-channel-is-she-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>YouTuber, Hayley LeBlanc Earns Quite A Revenue From Her YouTube Channel; Is She Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tammy-slaton-weight-loss-2022-how-much-weight-did-she-lose.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tammy Slaton Weight Loss 2022- How Much Weight Did She Lose?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
