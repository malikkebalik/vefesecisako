I want to make this video to tell you something very special. We are officially confirmed to sing this Sunday, March 27 at the 94th Oscars. I’m going to be singing ‘Two Caterpillars’ representing my country, Colombia, and having this great opportunity to represent our language, Spanish. I couldn’t be more excited, grateful. I have nerves, I feel a lot of things, but more than that, thanks to life for what is happening. Everything that happens never ceases to amaze me. Thank you.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>4. He Had A Chance To Practice On A Late Night Show</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sebastián had his first chance to perform “Two Caterpillars” in front of an international audience when he made a guest appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on March 14.

After John agreed to putting down his dulcet tones for the track, Sebastián told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>, “John is miraculously talented and musically he can go anywhere. He’s someone I admire, and vocal-wise, it’s very intriguing to see how he’s going to sound in a song like this because of his vocal capacity.” He added, “When you have a song you love so much, you want to give it to someone who has a stroke of genius like John has, and who will keep the essence instead of just a translation.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LApq7ArKuimZ5ixqLA0ZpkbW5oaYB2go4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
