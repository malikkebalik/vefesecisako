I thought that Brad was outside playing a trick on me with a whistle ... It was your crazy birds! I didn’t actually think that was possible to make that sound that early in the morning.</p><p>“We had our Christmas there as well, which was lovely. I love a hot Christmas.”</p><p>Miyavi, a Japanese rock star who played a WWII camp guard in <i>Unbroken</i>, hung out with the Jolie-Pitts at the Zoo in November 2013 and observed a close, fun-loving clan.</p><p>“Brad came from London to celebrate Pax’s birthday and Thanksgiving,” Miyavi revealed. “The kids ran around the campfire and then slept in little tents. We all got animal onesies. I got a penguin, Brad got an alligator and Angie got a zebra. We wore them that night.</p><p>“It was my first time to hang out with Brad. He was so natural. He and Angie are great parents. They dedicate themselves to their kids.”</p><p>Pitt had previously visited Australia for the first time in June of 2103 — making a flying visit to promote his movie <i>World War Z</i> with son Pax, then nine, in tow.</p><p>“It’s even better than it looks on TV,” Pitt said while in Sydney. He added that they were just “in for a barbecue and then out’”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e8Keo56aop7BunnLop2eZ5ikvKx51KmqZpqimq6sedSpqmiaopaxbrzIratmmZ6csq21zZpko6ecnrJutMCdZJ%2BhoqjBbrzUm6Oim12btqi002agp2WjrrGvsdhmmZ6en6eybsHNm6moo5WjerG%2BxKagnqqVZLumw9Jmqq2noq58cYTFamtsnGRofaeywW2danFlln6isZJyaWmcYpqucoA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hayley-marie-norman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hayley Marie Norman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pete-akatsa-died-know-everything-about-his-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pete Akatsa Died: Know Everything About His Death?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
