He was 4 years old, less than half of his eldest grandson’s age. “His parents are very excited and delighted that he is a page,” a rep for &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a> and &nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Prince William</a></strong> told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>last month. “It’s something that his parents have thought long and hard about and are very much looking forward to — and I ‘m sure George is too.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Meanwhile, a royal source told the publication that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are “cognizant that he is old enough to understand what’s going on,” which also includes his understanding that life will return to normal after his big job at the coronation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>As mentioned above, George is the firstborn child of William and Kate.
