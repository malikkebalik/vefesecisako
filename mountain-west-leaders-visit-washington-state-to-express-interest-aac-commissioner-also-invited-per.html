The American Athletic Conference is also interested in the two schools, and commissioner Mike Aresco has also been invited to visit after virtual presentations that are expected next week, a source briefed on the situation told <i data-stringify-type=italic>The Athletic.</i></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>As both “Group of 5” conferences jockey to add the Pac-12 remnants, no decisions are expected to be made by WSU and OSU until <a class=ath_autolink data-id=248 href=#>Stanford</a>’s and Cal’s futures are determined. There is growing momentum in the ACC to add Stanford and Cal, but no vote has been scheduled yet.</p><p>WSU’s athletics advisory committee, which met with Mountain West leaders and will meet with the AAC, is made up of students, faculty, staff and alumni and provides input to Schultz and athletic director Pat Chun. WSU has said it has three options: the Mountain West, the AAC or attempting to rebuild the Pac-12 with Stanford and Cal.</p><h2>The Mountain West</h2><p>“President Stokes emphasized that the conference’s top priority is the success and well-being of its student-athletes,” WSU said in a statement.</p><p>“She also discussed the similarities between Mountain West schools and WSU. The Mountain West Conference is comprised of a mix of land-grant and flagship universities and includes six R-1 designated research institutions. Commissioner Nevarez described the member schools of the conference as being gritty, resilient, strivers, and trailblazers. She also touted the conference’s focus on first-generation college students and the league’s leadership position in diversity, equity, and inclusion.”</p><p>The Mountain West’s pitch to WSU and OSU begins with geography, as the last West Coast-based Football Bowl Subdivision conference if the Pac-12 ends, featuring schools like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=232 href=#>Boise State</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=240 href=#>San Diego State</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=233 href=#>Colorado State</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=236 href=#>Air Force</a> and others and making for some natural new rivalries. After the most recent realignment, the league hopes it can establish itself as the top G5 league again heading into a 12-team College Football Playoff era. It’s also been a very strong basketball conference, as evidenced by SDSU’s run to this year’s men’s national championship game.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>'Be us': How San Diego State rallied to beat FAU, make the national title game</p></a><p>The conference has media rights deals with Fox and CBS through 2026 worth about $3.7 million per full member school annually (Boise State gets a bigger share), as part of a total payout worth about $6 million per school annually, according to league sources. Adding any new schools would open negotiations with media partners to potentially increase that number.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Pac-12 paid members an average of $37 million per school in the most recent fiscal year. Whatever the decision, WSU and OSU will see a sizable drop in conference payout revenue.</p><h2>The AAC</h2><p>The AAC’s pitch to WSU and OSU is about ESPN and investment. The conference has been the most dominant G5 league, earning the coveted New Year’s Six bowl spot seven times in nine years — though the teams that produced five of those seven have joined the Big 12. Still, the league on average has higher coaching salaries and athletic budgets than the Mountain West.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Revamped by realignment, the AAC isn't planning for a drop-off</p></a><p>The AAC also has an ESPN exclusive deal through 2031-32 that pays founding members an average of around $7 million for a total conference payout of around $8 million to&nbsp; $9 million (less for recently added members), per league sources. Like the Mountain West, that number could go up if it adds the two schools. The AAC would pitch the exposure, longevity and security of its deal in an uncertain time for media rights.</p><p>The conference also has high-academic schools like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=159 href=#>Tulane</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=209 href=#>Rice</a>, and USF recently became an AAU member. As for the increased travel, the conference is based in Texas and has a majority of its teams in the Central Time Zone and in major cities, which can ease the burden. The AAC is also waiting to see if the ACC takes Dallas-based <a class=ath_autolink data-id=158 href=#>SMU</a> alongside Stanford and Cal.</p><p>WSU and OSU will need to make decisions quickly, especially to begin scheduling for next season, but a final resolution isn’t expected until after the AAC makes its pitches and visits, which is at least a week away. It also first depends on what happens with Stanford and Cal.&lt;</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: William Mancebo / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3FncGpkaHxzfJFsZmlwX2eDcMPArJ%2BippepvK950q2YrZ1dory2utOaoKdlp5rAtXnAppyroZOWu26t06GjnqyZmHqku82fnKudnpiycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./photos-deadliest-catch-s-edgar-hansen-spine-injury-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PHOTOS Deadliest Catchs Edgar Hansen spine injury update</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-bowen-li-on-masterchef-2022-wikipedia-and-ethnicity-where-is-he-from-tassco-the-talks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Bowen Li On MasterChef 2022?
