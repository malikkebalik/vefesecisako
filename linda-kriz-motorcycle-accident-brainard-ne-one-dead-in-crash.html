The accident took place close to the intersection of Casa Linda Drive and Norton Street. The accident took place as a result of a collision between the child and a pickup truck.</p><p>During the rush hour traffic that occurred before to the beginning of classes at Baker Middle School, the reports that the cars were moving in the incorrect direction were brought to the attention of the police. According to the statements made by the authorities, the individual who was driving the pickup truck at the time of the incident that resulted in the collision was in the process of driving two children to their respective schools when the incident occurred.</p><p>The motorcyclist, on the other hand, was heading in the complete opposite direction. The truck driver was attempting to make a left turn into Casa Linda when the incident took place. The driver allegedly had their eyes covered, and as a result, they were unable to see the rider who was in the road. This information comes from the police.</p><p>Despite the fact that it appeared to the police that the motorcyclist had not sustained any significant injuries as a result of the accident, the officer decided to transport the rider to the hospital just in case. His mother, Linda Caldera, claimed that her son sustained a concussion as a result of the incident, as stated in claims that were made by Linda Caldera in an interview with KRIS 6 News.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwuMinm5plm6e2u3nMqKuoqpOusK2xjJqanKGUmru1ecGrmKKmkaexbrrEZqannV2ZsqKwjKKlZpuilsCpew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matthew-daddario-actor-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-married-wife-net-worth-career-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matthew Daddario (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Married, Wife, Net Worth, Career, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laila-ali-siblings-the-enduring-legacy-of-muhammad-ali.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Laila Ali Siblings: The Enduring Legacy of Muhammad Ali</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
