He has amassed more than 4.2 million followers and more than 2.7 million subscribers respectively on those 2 platforms. Between&nbsp;April 2016 and January 2018, he had been banned from playing the game due to his disruptive behavior towards other players, the incident earning him the nickname of ‘The Most Toxic Player in North America’. Upon reinstatement, his very first&nbsp;League of Legends had recorded more than 386k viewers on Twitch, a figure that was the platform’s largest non-tournament concurrent viewership at that time. In October 2020, he was signed up by the South Korean esports team T1, as a content creator. He is popular on other social media platforms as well with more than 750k followers on Instagram and more than 600k followers on Twitter.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Tyler Steinkamp</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>tyler1, T1, The Most Toxic Player in North America</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tyler1-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-March-2017.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Pisces</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Missouri, United States</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>New London, Ralls County, Missouri, United States</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=American src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/United-States.png alt=American width=64 height=47 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Education</h3><p>tyler1, after his high school graduation, had&nbsp;studied computer science at the <strong>Central Methodist University</strong>, a private university in Fayette, Missouri, before withdrawing to focus on his streaming career.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>YouTuber, Gamer, Social Media Influencer, Twitch Streamer</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/United-States.png><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Siblings</strong>&nbsp;– Eric Lamont Robbins Jr. (Younger Brother) (Twitch Streamer)</li></ul><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 6 in or 167.5 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>72 kg or 159 lbs</p><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>tyler1 has dated –</p><li><a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Macaiyla</strong></a> (2016-Present)</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tyler1-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-September-2016.jpg><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>White</p><p>He is of American descent.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Dark Brown</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Green</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Close-cropped hair</li><li>Clean-shaven look</li><li>Affable smile</li></ul><h3>Brand Endorsements</h3><p>Buffalo Wild Wings, Old Spice</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tyler1-and-Macaiyla-as-seen-in-November-2020.jpg><h3>tyler1 Facts</h3><li>By 2014, he had made it up the 14th position on the North American League of Legends ladder. However, his stream was only modestly followed at that time and he was known more in the gaming community for his toxic behavior on his stream, including personally attacking other players, encouraging players to commit suicide, and intentionally losing the game thus harming his teammates. This eventually led to permanent bans on 22 of his unique accounts.</li><li>In the early part of April 2016, he had announced that he had ‘reformed’ his behavior which saw a sudden spike in his Twitch following. However, his behavior began to worsen soon enough, and by the end of the month, Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends, had announced that they would be ‘ID Banning’ him, meaning that accounts used by him to play publicly on stream would be immediately banned, even if no rules were broken on the account.</li><li>In October 2017, a Riot Games employee had made derogatory remarks about him on the official r/LeagueOfLegends Subreddit’s Discord server. The company later apologized to tyler1 soon and in a few days, the aforementioned employee had been sacked from the organization.</li><li>In November 2017, he had hosted an online League of Legends tournament called the Tyler1 Championship Series (TCS), a parody of the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS).</li><li>While he was studying at Central Methodist University, he used to play as a running back for the university’s football team.</li><li>In October 2021, Tyler1 had lost in the Fall Guys $50k Twitch Rivals event.</li><p>Featured Image by tyler1 / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq2wpZ2iZnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-morgan-harvey-s-husband-kareem-hawthorne.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All About Morgan Harveys Husband, Kareem Hawthorne</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarai-jones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarai Jones</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
