I'm on the lowest dose. I don't see the point of getting off of it. Whether it's placebo or not, I don't want to risk it. And what are you fighting against? Just the stigma of using a tool? A mental illness is a thing that people cast in a different category [from other illnesses], but I don't think it is. It should be taken as seriously as anything else. [2016]</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>2</td><td>I've been disconnected with the sexual side of me. I know it's in me, but it doesn't really reveal itself very often in my personal life. Which I do find problematic! And I am working through that, and finding that side of me. [But] I don't know what to do with my hands when those sex scenes come on! I usually cover my eyes when I'm doing something questionable! So, it's really awkward for me. I can never really wrap my head around how I'm supposed to behave, or how I'm supposed to feel.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>3</td><td>Am I confident about my looks? No. Not even a little bit. But this is the way I look, and I'm stuck with it. I work out hard, but I'm never going to be confident about getting into a bikini. Some days, I look at myself and think, "Ugh, I can't go anywhere," and other days I feel, "Yeah, I look okay." I just put on a pretty dress and a ton of make-up and get on with it.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>4</td><td>[on mysterious men] Mystery is really sexy. Bad guys also tend to be really self-centered and very fearless--I don't know why, but that is sexy. It shouldn't be: it's disgusting.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>5</td><td>[on full-frontal nudity] I'm pretty sure I would never do a full-frontal in a movie--for personal reasons, I wouldn't really want to show that.</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>6</td><td>[on singing] Sometimes, I would sing around the house for two hours straight, but I didn't want anyone to hear me up close. I would sing all the Broadway show-tunes, like, "Cabaret". Our cat started hating me. He went from being affectionate, to being almost scared of me. Our theory was that when I was singing around the house, I hit notes that hurt his little ears. That is what I tell myself anyway!</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>7</td><td>I don't think men find me irresistible at all. I've got a filthy side and a romantic side--I like to keep them guessing.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>8</td><td>[on her childhood] I felt so extremely ugly. When I look back, I was not ugly--I was cute, and had a gap in my teeth. But I wish I could have enjoyed that part of my life and be more confident.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>9</td><td>[on her childhood] I was super outgoing until I was around 10. I got a bit older and started getting shy. Way too shy.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>10</td><td>[on her developing interest in taxidermy] I love animals and they're very easy to look after when they're dead. I recently decided I was going to start building a parliament of owls.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>11</td><td>[on her modeling career] I was naturally skinny and had braces, so I wasn't a cute model. I never felt pretty but it was fun, and I got a cool paycheck to buy sweets with.</td></tr><tr readability=8.956043956044><td>12</td><td>Sex scenes are great. A lot of my co-stars have been sexy guys my age, and so, why not? I'm not going to pretend it's not fun. Justin [<a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>] was great--he had come from doing <a href=#>Friends with Benefits</a> (2011), where he basically had sex every day at work--and so it was easy for both of us. We just kind of got it on, and then were like, "That was good".</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>13</td><td>No matter what's happening in my life, I can always get lost in the romances of my characters.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>14</td><td>People do judge you, and there are stupid rivalries. You have to wear the right things, because there are all these girls my age competing for the same roles. They're judging me and I'm judging them. I try not to be that way, but sometimes I am.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>15</td><td>It's really easy to avoid the tabloids. You just live your life and don't hang out with famous people who are in the tabloids. Don't do anything controversial and be a normal person. Have friends. And get a job and keep working.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>16</td><td>[on being in a polygamous marriage] I don't think I could share, no. I don't think I would trust. I want to be the most important thing in my husband's life. It's just weird. It's not natural.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>17</td><td>I've auditioned for roles that involved voice, but I don't like it. I feel like, "I can't do this in front of you". It seems so separate--I don't share it with a lot of people. And I'm not into public performances.</td></tr><tr readability=4.616724738676><td>18</td><td>[on playing the lead role in <a href=#>Mamma Mia!</a> (2008)] It doesn't really get better than this. I'm afraid I'm going to just have to beg Meryl [<a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>] to do another movie with me. She's so in touch with herself. I know that comes with age, but I'm really excited to figure out who I am.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>19</td><td>I have jeans with holes in them and I have nice jeans. I have casual and I have dressy jeans. I've got all kinds.</td></tr><tr readability=4.4918032786885><td>20</td><td>At 11, I had a crush on <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. Actually, it was not a crush. It was an obsession! I was also obsessed with <a href=#>Richard Dean Anderson</a>, from <a href=#>MacGyver</a> (1985) and Indiana Jones.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>21</td><td>I'm not really into clubbing, I like to go to parties after events, and those do end up at clubs or bars. But in my free time, I go grocery shopping or to the gym, or I talk on the phone.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>22</td><td>I just love to act and be on the set. I want to make acting my life and get really good roles.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>23</td><td>I do feel like I've grown up. Living by yourself in two cities, having a relationship, the Hollywood stuff. It forces you to deal with things as an adult.</td></tr><tr readability=5.6629213483146><td>24</td><td>[on <a href=#>Mamma Mia!</a> (2008)] I had never seen the stage show. When I first heard about the audition, I was like, "Damn, I'm not Greek!". I thought it was about this big Greek family.</td></tr><tr readability=7.5571955719557><td>25</td><td>[on plans for the future] If I came out with a club hit, if I were singing duets with <a href=#>Jesse McCartney</a>, I think people would get the wrong idea. I'm not interested in fashion design. I'm an actress, and that's all I want to focus on. For me, that's just more fulfilling.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>26</td><td>Jeans are just so sexy, there's something about them that turns me on, you know?</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>27</td><td>I collect jeans.
