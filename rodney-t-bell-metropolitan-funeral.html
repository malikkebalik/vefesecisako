Bell departed this life Oct. 15, 2022 while living in Daytona Beach, Florida.</p><p class=p1>Born to the late George M. Bell and Delores A. English Bell on July 10, 1960 in Norfolk, Rodney spent his formative years in the Liberty Park and Bowling Park public housing communities. He attended segregated elementary schools in both neighborhoods. Rodney subsequently became a part of Norfolk desegregation efforts in 1971 when he was bused to Lansdale Elementary School for grades five and six.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>From 1972-1975, Rodney attended Jacox Junior High School, and later, Norview High School, where he graduated in 1978.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Faced with few options after graduation, Rodney followed three uncles into the U.S. Army. He was trained at Fort Sill, Okla., as a “Red Legger,” commonly known as a field artilleryman. Rodney loved the Army, especially the physical challenges and time spent outdoors. The highlight of his 13 years in uniform were the tours he spent in Germany and Denmark. He often recalled with fondness his experiences in such cities as Heidelberg, Paris and Amsterdam.</p><p class=p1>Following service in Europe, Rodney was assigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he met the former Pat Banks. They married in the early 1980s and the union produced Rodney Tremale Bell Jr. The couple parted ways some years later.</p><p class=p1>After his honorable discharge in 1991 at Fort Hood, Rodney returned to Norfolk. He undertook work in construction and other jobs. To change his environment and to pursue other job opportunities, he moved to Daytona Beach later in the decade. A daughter, Briana Smith, was born there, and he married for the second time, to Emma Jean McDonald. He held several jobs in Daytona Beach, most of them in hotel maintenance.</p><p class=p1>Rodney will be remembered for his big-kid demeanor and ways – a heaping bowl of cereal while watching cartoons was one of his favorite pastimes — his comedy; his mischief; his love of sports; and his affection for learning. He will be mostly remembered, however, for his humor, doses of which would be served generously to those who best knew him. In that respect, as most would agree, he was a “fool.”</p><p class=p1>Despite a proclivity to create laughter, Rodney had a serious side, too. He could talk about politics for hours or watch news and wildlife documentaries to no end. Rodney was also a student of the Bible, having given his life to the Lord after struggles with addiction. He would often bait people into discussions about scripture. Lastly, Rodney was a dreamer, often imagining adventurous excursions of some sort. Up until his last moments on Earth, he longed for the experience of living in a log cabin and riding a slow horse along the desolate pastures of the Montana wilderness. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Rodney Tremale Bell was preceded in death by his mother and father, Delores Cooper and George Bell; his stepmother Uradell Clayton; his maternal grandfather and grandmother, Albert English Sr. and Frances Prince English; his step-grandfather Luke Bell and his grandmother, Ida Bell; his grandfather Harry Knight Sr.; and his uncles, Albert English Jr., Charles English and Melvin English.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>He leaves behind his wife, Emma Jean McDonald; son, Rodney T. Bell Sr.; granddaughter, Aubree Londyn Patrice Bell; daughter, Briana Smith; and three unknown children living in Europe. He also is survived by siblings Terrance Bell, Bevelon Bell Washington; and Wesley Bell; uncles Robert English and Marvin English; aunts Cynthia Wright, Sabrina Sibley and Francine Johnson; sister-in-law Donna Bell; brother-in-law Darrell Washington; and numerous cousins, aunts, nieces, nephews and other relatives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNoqp%2BZu6bFjK1km52coXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./silje-torp-f%C3%A6ravaag-age-wiki-bio-height-workout-net-worth-husband-and-bikini-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Silje Torp Fravaag | Age, Wiki/Bio, height, Workout, Net worth, Husband and Bikini Photo,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pink-draco.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pink Draco</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
