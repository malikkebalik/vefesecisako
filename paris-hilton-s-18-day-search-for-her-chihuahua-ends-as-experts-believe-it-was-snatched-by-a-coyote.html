We’ve had a major hunt with worldwide coverage, but there hasn’t been a single sighting. If a dog is loose, there are usually many sightings in a scenario like this.</p><p>‘If Diamond Baby had been dognapped, we would have expected a ransom demand by now. But there have been no calls.</p><p>The hotel heiress, 41, shown with Diamond Baby, began a dramatic social media campaign last week to find the six-year-old chihuahua, whom she described as “like a daughter to me.”</p><p>She also recruited a company that uses heat-seeking drones, as well as an army of pet detectives, psychics, and expert dog trackers, to explore the area around her Mulholland Estates house.</p><p>‘From the beginning, the worry has always been that Diamond Baby may have fallen victim to wild coyotes due of the terrain&nbsp;. There has been a record heatwave in Los Angeles, and coyotes are congregating in residential areas in search of food and water. They are starving.’</p><p>Ms Hilton is claimed to have “not given up hope” for pet Baby, who lives in a £280,000 “doggie house” and with a £35,000 diamond-encrusted collar.</p><p>‘She’s upset, but she’ll never lose up on Diamond Baby,’ claimed a family member.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC8wKugrGWYnrm1u82sZGpwXZmuunnSnpirm5his7C%2BjKGcq2WTnbapwcChrJpllaOxtHnArGSesKCav7W%2FjJucpaGVq7JutdNmrpqrXai7osDCoZydZZKueqJ5wqiwqKyVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-forgany-hospitalized-in-2023-health-information-in-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Forgany Hospitalized In 2023 | Health Information In 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-walsh-unveiling-the-financial-success-of-a-comedic-talent.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Walsh: Unveiling The Financial Success Of A Comedic Talent</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
