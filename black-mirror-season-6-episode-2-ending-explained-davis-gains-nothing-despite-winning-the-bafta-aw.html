But the tiny town has a sinister story that has drained the tourism off its shores. A man named Iain Adair killed a couple on honeymoon in a bunker of his cottage and later shot his parents and himself before the police could catch him.</p><p>Davis’s friend, Stuart owns a local pub. Davis and Pia arrive and conversations flare off. Davis and Stuart tell Pia about Adair’s story and his heinous deeds of murdering multiple people and specifically Dawn and Simon Challis, the honeymoon couple who visited the town. Before Pia could ask any further questions, Davis revealed that his father was a local policeman who was also shot by Adair when he went to confront him on the unfortunate night when he killed himself. All these killings a while ago had given a bad reputation to the town and since Adair’s discovery, tourists have looked away from the picturesque beauty of this small town. Pia now wants to make a crime-specific documentary on Adair’s killings and tries to convince Davis. Stuart is on board as a film on Loch Henry will only help accelerate the town’s economy once again. But as Davis is injured after an accident, Pia learns about the truth behind the killing of the honeymoon couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/69d30500-a456-4da0-8753-9d1c0ba1f23e.png><h2 class=split>Janet and her love for Bergerac expose her</h2><p>Janet, Davis’s mother is a big fan of the British crime drama television series, Bergerac. She often keeps tapes of the show to watch it later and unfortunately, this turns out to be her biggest mistake. When Pia returns to Davis’s house after he’s stuck in the hospital after a small accident, she resumes digitizing footage from tapes and then suddenly, the video sputters into another video. To her horror, Pia sees Janet in a red cabaret mask, torturing the honeymoon couple with Kenneth and Adair. The trio had made a snuff film. Janet returns to the room and Pia freezes. She knows that Janet is the manic killer behind the murders of Dawn and Simon which was pinned on Adair until now.&nbsp;</p><p>She manages to flee the house but Janet chases her in her car. When Pia tries to cross the river, she slips and smacks her head on a rock, and her dead body drifts along the water. In a moment of truth, Janet returns home, gathers all the evidence of her killing deeds, puts it in a box, writes a note for her son, and then hangs herself.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Davis wins but at what costs?</h2><p>Davis and Pia were asked by a producer to find a more personal angle to the story of Davis’ dad being shot by the Adair and his subsequent death. She asks for something unseen, unheard, and unexplored. The duo even break into the Adair house and film fresh footage of the murder room but given Pia’s discovery about Davis’ mother and then Janet hanging herself to death, there was little left for Davis to live for despite his documentary ‘Loch Henry: Truth Will Out’ winning the BAFTA award for Best Documentary Feature. He’s unmoved and unfazed by all the preceding events and locks himself in a hotel room, drinking alone. Even though the town of Loch Henry has gained tourists after the release of the documentary, Davis has lost his mother, her friend, and the will to give a f**k about the winning prize.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Black Mirror’ Season 6 is currently streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRompyWsKx5zKKpq6eiYsCmrdKopWZuXZq9qr%2FOnZxmal2au6W1zaBknrCgoa6qusSdZJ2Zpp7AbrPAoqWsZZ6kwam1zaBknZ2jpba1sYywoKemmaO0bsDHnmSbmZaprm6t1pqpnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dalilin-da-ya-sa-murja-kunya-ta-ci-gaba-da-hawa-tiktok-duk-da-umarnin-kotu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dalilin da Ya Sa Murja Kunya Ta Ci Gaba da Hawa TikTok Duk da Umarnin Kotu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./youtuber-hayley-leblanc-earns-quite-a-revenue-from-her-youtube-channel-is-she-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>YouTuber, Hayley LeBlanc Earns Quite A Revenue From Her YouTube Channel; Is She Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
