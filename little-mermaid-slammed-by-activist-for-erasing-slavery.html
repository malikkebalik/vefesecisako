Race as a social construct, as we know it, clearly does not exist underwater.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Halle Bailey as Ariel. <span class=credit>© Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>However, in the blog, titled “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney’s the Little Mermaid, Caribbean Slavery, and Telling the Truth to Children</a>,” Ryder points out that the movie appears to take place in the Caribbean in the 18th century during a time of African chattel slavery — yet the islanders depicted in the film seem to live in a world free of this inhumanity.</p><p>“In this setting, I do not think we do our children any favors by pretending that slavery didn’t exist,” he wrote. “For me Disney’s preference to try and wish the inconvenient truth away says more about the adult creatives than it does about children’s ability to work through it.”</p><p>Though he acknowledged that the movie is a fantasy and doesn’t necessarily need to be historically accurate, he said that Disney shouldn’t be “encouraging historical amnesia.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“The Little Mermaid” is top at the box office, grossing over $217 million worldwide since opening last Friday, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo. <span class=credit>© Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>“But the total erasure and rewriting of one of the most painful and important parts of African diasporic history, is borderline dangerous, especially when it is consumed unquestioningly by children,” he added.</p><p>Ryder proposed that Disney could have instead set the live-action film in Haiti after slavery was overthrown, with Ariel meeting Prince Eric in the wake of real racial harmony and not sacrificing historical accuracy.</p><p>“We owe it to our children to give them the most amazing fantastical stories possible to help their imaginations grow,” Ryder said. “We do not do this by ‘whitewashing’ out the difficult parts of our history. We do it by embracing our rich history and empowering them with the truth.”</p><p>After the blog went viral, Ryder <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took to Twitter</a> to clarify his comments to readers.</p><p>“The sad reality is this great film left me concerned that Disney did not take seriously this very sensitive time and place which due to the atrocities that happened there should be treated very carefully – especially for impressionable children,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he wrote</a> in the Twitter thread.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He added</a>, “For the record I liked the film. There are a lot of positive elements – one of them being the casting and normalizing of Black beauty – but that does not mean I don’t think there aren’t flaws that could have been addressed better.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Though he acknowledged that the movie is a fantasy and doesn’t necessarily need to be historically accurate, he said that Disney shouldn’t be “encouraging historical amnesia.” <span class=credit>Giles Keyte / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ryder proposed that Disney could have instead set the live-action film in Haiti after slavery was overthrown. <span class=credit>© Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>This comes shortly after the news that IMDb <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">changed</a>&nbsp;its rating system for the newly released film amid “<a href=#>unusual voting activity</a>.”</p><p>“Our rating mechanism has detected unusual voting activity on this title. To preserve the reliability of our rating system, an alternate weighting calculation has been applied,” a note on the US, Canadian, UK, Brazilian and Mexican “Little Mermaid” pages reads — after some “review bombers” gave the movie negative scores for no good reason.</p><p>Regardless,&nbsp;<a href=#>“The Little Mermaid”</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top at the box office</a>, grossing&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over $217 million worldwide</a>&nbsp;since opening last Friday,&nbsp;according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maWpfoba1wMueZKadoqKuqrCMrKOapZ2asW6u2GaYnKyZq7a0wIyfpqtllaeutLXNoGSspJGrsrPFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./odell-beckham-jr-kisses-girlfriend-lauren-wood-after-super-bowl-win-hollywood-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Odell Beckham Jr. Kisses Girlfriend Lauren Wood After Super Bowl Win Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-smith-net-worth-pulptastic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Smith Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
