The show revolves around a handful of socialites, the friendships they share, and how they go about tackling everyday issues, most of which are blown out of proportion, leading to disagreements, bitterness and such.</p><p><strong>Thomas Ravenel's arrest</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/cc5a812f-795e-4a7b-a6e8-5b1a55dfc78b.jpg><p>The former South Carolina state treasurer was arrested following sexual assault allegations that were leveled against him by his kids', Kensie and Saint, former nanny Dawn Ledwell. Although, he escaped jail time, the incident impacted his personal life. Former partner Kathryn Dennis then went court demanding changes in custody settlement. She wanted to move their kids further away from him. However, the couple finally agreed to shared custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cameran Eubanks' exit</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e6263bbd-aadb-4323-8f94-784da3432d0d.jpg><p>This has been a topic of conversation ever since she announced her decision to not return to the show. Over the years, Cameran amassed loyal fans who were confused as to why she would leave the show after sharing that she was happy to be filming for Season 7. Naturally, there were speculations, which led to cheating rumors. Her social media account was flooded with questions. Most were curious to know her husband <a href=#>Jason Wimberly cheated on her</a> with a town <a href=# rel>makeup artist, Rebecca Wash</a>. She clapped back at the allegations saying she was hurt that people would bring him into it given how much of a "sincere and faithful human" he has been. Even the makeup artist implicated in all of this came forward to clear her name and shared that she never had an affair with him.</p><p><strong>Austen Kroll's threesome video</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/077b444b-744f-4e76-a74c-b03f22a358a9.jpg><p>This was quite the game-changer for Austen. He got himself more screen time with this because everybody was interested in the history behind the threesome video that was leaked to fitsnews.com. In the <a href=# rel=nofollow>video</a>, he is seen stepping out of his bedroom in his briefs defending his honor and stance to girlfriend Madison LeCroy, who leaves disgusted. Although, he explains that the women he was allegedly partying with had merely slept in his room. The controversy reaches a point where Austen had to explain himself anywhere he went.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shep Rose' chlamydia rumors</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/913488e2-194f-402c-aaf1-98530757a0bd.jpg><p>Madison, during a heated argument with Shep, claimed that he gave Danni Baird chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease. She even said her on-again-off-again boyfriend Austen gave her the information. However, both Shep and Danni were swift to deny the claims then and they have maintained their stance so far. "That is a lie. A blatant lie. It’s not a fact,” she said. “Madison, you can’t be throwing random s— around like that, it’s just not cool," Danni had said. While Shep said he doesn't understand Madison and how she knows only how to hurt people. The topic was brought up by Andy Cohen during the reunion episodes but nothing came of it because Shep and Danni stuck to their narrative while Austen casually sidelined the issue.</p><p><strong>Kathryn's drug abuse and rehab stint</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c3851f7e-5dec-4220-888a-945505e82a61.jpg><p>Kathryn has struggled with substance abuse for a while now. In 2016, she failed her drug test (tested positive for marijuana) following which she lost the custody of her kids, Kensie and Saint, and kickstarted a sobriety journey, which was documented in Seasons 4 and 5. Even though she came back stronger, the custody battle didn't stop following her until late 2019 when she was finally happy to have settled on shared custody with former partner Thomas.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch the 'Southern Charm' premiere on Bravo on October 29, Thursday on Bravo starting 9/8c.
