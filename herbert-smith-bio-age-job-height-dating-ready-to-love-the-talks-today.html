In the show, he piqued the interest of Janelle Langford in the first episode of the show. Janelle described him as “good looking, very beautiful, with great energy” and she was there for it all.</p><p>The couple flirted and touched each other so there were definitely sparks between the two.</p><p>Herbert tells Janelle that he was never married before and wants children (how many lords he says). Janelle thought their interaction “wasn’t forced” and was “good.”</p><p>According to his bio, he is a partnership manager. Ahead of the show’s premiere, Herbert posted on his IG: “So I did something… I’ve been on here looking for love for a while, but I haven’t heard back! 🤷🏾‍♂️😔You want different results, you have to try something different. So I figured I let the good people of @owntv introduce me to some of DFW’s most desirable bachelors and take part in the process of finding love! Take this journey with me Friday nights @ 7 on @ownkeepitreal or @hbomaxes/@StreamOnMax starting TONIGHT!! #ReadyToLove #ReadyToLoveseason8 #RTLSeason8 #RTL #Dallas #DallasTexas.”</p><p>In July 2023, a completely new season begins Ready for love pre-produced. The next season will feature a fresh set of singles who will try to find love on their OWN TV as they travel to Dallas. Only on OWN, the new season of Ready to Love will premiere on Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:00 PM ET.</p><p>A press release states, “These are grown men and women in their 30s and 40s looking for that special relationship that has eluded them, and the baggage everyone brings to the party is real.” This season of the reality dating show featured 18 singles who came together in an attempt to find love. This reality dating show follows singles in their 30s and 40s, which is unusual for most of them.</p><p>The cast of Ready to Love will meet at the Mansion Mixer in Dallas before the program airs. Even before the evening ends, the two actors will say goodbye.</p><p>By following their interactions with the men, the contestants and the men will decide which single man they do not want to know further. Each week, one bachelor’s mission to find love ends, so the remaining candidates must continue to try to win each other over. According to the press release, turmoil, love triangles and heartbreaks will threaten or strengthen budding romances.
