The CNN anchor dated Benjamin, an NYC-based bar owner, from 2009 to 2018, during which they enjoyed what seemed to be a blissful relationship. And even after they broke up, the two stayed apart of each other’s lives in a major way: Benjamin has been helping Anderson raise son <strong>Wyatt Cooper</strong>, whom Anderson <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed via surrogate</a> in April 2020. Talk about friendly exes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But what are the ins and outs of their current relationship? And who has Anderson dated since their split? Find out where the duo stands today and what’s up with the CNN icon below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/benjamin-maisani-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed.jpg><h2>Benjamin and Anderson’s romance lasted 9 years.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Benjamin, a Hunter College grad, and Anderson Cooper’s romance began in 2009, though the circumstances of how they meant aren’t confirmed. The couple did not go public with their relationship until 2015, three years after Anderson came out as gay. Anderson and Benjamin made several public appearances together while they were dating and also enjoyed some vacations as a couple, including trips to Venice, Italy and Tahiti in 2017.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In March 2018, Anderson announced he split from Benjamin.<br>“Benjamin and I separated as boyfriends some time ago, we are still family to each other, and love each other very much,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Entertainment Tonight</i>.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/benjamin-maisani-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><h2></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>However, the NYC bar owner and the journalist have continued their journey and&nbsp;have been on great terms. In fact, Benjamin has been a co-parent to Anderson’s 1-year-old son <strong>Wyatt Cooper&nbsp;</strong>ever since the little one was born in April 2020. The two even still live together in the Big Apple raising baby Wyatt. “There is no acrimony between us,” Anderson told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;last year of his relationship with Benjamin. “Even though it’s maybe unconventional because he’s my ex, he is my family.” The political commentator added, “While we were a couple, he wasn’t sure he wanted kids, which was one of the issues we’d always had.&nbsp;But when I decided, ‘I’m just going to do this,’ he started to be interested.”</p><h2>Would they ever get back together?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>So would the exes ever get back together? That seems to be a definitive no. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> asked Anderson just that while she was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interviewing him</a> on her talk show in February 2021.&nbsp;“No, that’s not gonna happen!” Anderson confidently responded. However, Anderson did once again applaud his ex in the interview, saying that Benjamin “is such a great parent.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/benjamin-maisani-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed2.jpg><h2>Who is Anderson dating now?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>It’s unclear whether Anderson is currently dating someone else, though he has been linked to TV personality <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. It’s a charge both parties, however, have denied. “What is it about Anderson Cooper that keeps you from falling in love with him?” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> asked during an episode of his show in January of 2022. “I just think it’s not what our relationship is based on,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a> host replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“We’re just friends; that’s not a part of it. I think, at this point, we know each other too well. We’re not attracted to each other in that way.”&nbsp;While he admitted that Anderson is “a handsome guy,” he added that, “we’re not in that place.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The BFFs explained in a joint interview how the rumors may have started. Though they admitted they’d been set up for a blind date back in the 90s, it never happened. “I knew within 45 seconds, I was never going on a date with&nbsp;Andy Cohen,” Anderson hilariously told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> during<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a 2017 appearance</a> on The Tonight Show&nbsp;of their first meeting.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I imagined him in like a Bluetooth headset, gesticulating,” he added. “He was all excited, and he violated my cardinal rule, which is he asked me about my mom within the first minute of talking to me.” Andy exclaimed, “I wanted to date the Vanderbilt boy! I was excited.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Distractify</a>, Anderson has also been linked romantically to a Dallas radiologist named <strong>Victor Lopez.&nbsp;</strong>They reportedly started dating early in 2018, but had parted ways by the end of that same year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Cnm56qo6S7bq%2FOqKeeql2lrrPAzZ6pZmxkbYZ0hZRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-julia-fox-acknowledges-red-flags-in-relationship-with-kanye-west.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actress Julia Fox Acknowledges &amp;quot;Red Flags&amp;quot; In Relationship With Kanye West</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vanderpump-rules-lala-kent-doubts-brock-fans-say-she-only-sees-others-red-flags.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Vanderpump Rules': Lala Kent doubts Brock, fans say 'she only sees others' red flags'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
