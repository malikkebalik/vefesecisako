She met Pablo Romero, singer of the band Árbol, who heard her singing and invited her to make a disc of covers from different bands from El Oeste (the western zone of Greater Buenos Aires). It was there that she recorded her first song, “Mañana en el Abasto”, by Sumo.</p><p>After that, they proposed that she record some demos of pop music. The process lasted two years, until they obtained five songs which they presented to producer Gustavo Santaolalla.</p><p>2) Flor is a musical project of vocalist Zachary Grace, bassist Dylan William, guitarist McKinley Kitts, and drummer Kyle Hill. Their musical style is described by them as a "blend of indie rock and synth pop into an atmospherically hooky sound".<br>The band got its start in Hood River, Oregon, when Grace experimented with electronic musical programs to make "ear catching synth sounds." William would then build tracks around these snippets, turning them into songs that, while based on 80s sounds, were updated for the 21st century. Flor would also work with photographer/designer Jade Ehlers, who made visuals for the band; meanwhile, William established himself as a producer working with Flor, as well as artists like Halsey and Lostboycrow. The band would release their debut single, "Heart," online in 2014, with the Sounds EP arriving that October. Following the release of the 2015 full-length Sights & Sounds, Flor signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2016, which reissued the Sounds EP that February. The band's first album for the label, come out. you're hiding, was released in May 2017. Featured on the album was the single "Guarded." After releasing a single in 2018 called "Get Behind This", they would later release the ley lines album, then the Reimagined EP on 2020 with a guest collaborator, MisterWives, on their cover of Coldplay's "Yellow". In 2022, they released the EP "Skate/Big Shot/Play Along", which contain 3 titular tracks that are planned to be released on their future album, Future Shine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifKK4wa6kaH6cpL9wuMyhpphlj4i2r7PLng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-blodgett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Blodgett</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./devin-hester-celebrity-profile-hollywood-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Devin Hester Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
