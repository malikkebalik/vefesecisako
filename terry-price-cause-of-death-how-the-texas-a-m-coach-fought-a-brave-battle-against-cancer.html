He was a beloved figure in the college football world, known for his talent, passion, and integrity. He left behind his wife, Kenya, and their two sons, Alexander and Devin.</p><p>But what was the cause of Terry Price’s death? How did he cope with his illness? And how will he be remembered by his colleagues, players, and fans?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Diagnosis: Stage IV Cancer</h2><p>The cause of Terry Price’s death was Stage IV cancer, an advanced stage of the disease. Although specific details regarding the type and progression of the cancer have not been disclosed, it is clear that Price faced a prolonged and arduous battle against this formidable illness.</p><p>Stage IV cancer means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or brain. It is also known as metastatic cancer or secondary cancer. The treatment options for Stage IV cancer depend on the type and location of the cancer, as well as the patient’s overall health and preferences. Some common treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or palliative care.</p><p>The survival rate for Stage IV cancer varies depending on the type and subtype of the cancer. However, in general, it is lower than for earlier stages of the disease. According to Cancer.net, the five-year relative survival rate for all cancers combined is 27% for Stage IV cancer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Fight: Courage and Determination</h2><p>Despite his diagnosis, Terry Price did not give up on his life or his career. He continued to work as the defensive line coach for the Texas A&M Aggies until his final days. He was a key component in helping the defense of the Aggies transition to a 4-3 defense, which has paid off hugely for the program.</p><p>He also maintained a positive attitude and a strong faith throughout his ordeal. He was an inspiration to his players, who admired his resilience and dedication. He was also supported by his family, friends, and colleagues, who rallied around him and offered their prayers and encouragement.</p><p>One of his former players, Myles Garrett, who is now a star defensive end for the Cleveland Browns in the NFL, posted a heartfelt tribute to Price on Instagram. He wrote:</p><p>“Coach Price was more than just a coach to me. He was a mentor, a friend, a father figure. He taught me how to play the game with passion and integrity. He also taught me how to face adversity with courage and grace. He was always there for me, whether it was to celebrate my successes or to comfort me in my failures. He was one of the reasons I chose Texas A&M, and I will always be grateful for his guidance and influence in my life. Rest in peace, Coach. You will be missed.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Legacy: A Life Well Lived</h2><p>Terry Price will be remembered as one of the best defensive line coaches in college football history. He had a remarkable career that spanned over three decades and involved working with some of the most prestigious programs in the nation.</p><p>He started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Texas A&M in 1990-91, after playing for the Aggies from 1986-89 as a standout defensive lineman. He then moved on to coach at Ole Miss from 1995-98 and 2009-11, Auburn from 1999-2008, and Texas A&M again from 2012-23.</p><p>He was known for his ability to recruit and develop defensive linemen stars such as Myles Garrett, Justin Madubuike, DeMarvin Leal, and Dylon Mack. He also helped his teams achieve success on the field, as he was part of 21 bowl games during his coaching career.</p><p>He was respected and admired by his peers in the coaching fraternity, who praised his professionalism and character. Jimbo Fisher, the head coach of Texas A&M, said:</p><p>“Terry Price was not only a great coach but a great person. He had a positive impact on everyone he met. He was a loyal friend and a faithful servant. He loved Texas A&M and he loved his players. He was a true Aggie through and through. I am honored to have worked with him and learned from him. He will be sorely missed by all of us in the Aggie family.”</p><p>Terry Price lived a life that was full of achievements, challenges, joys, and sorrows. He faced them all with dignity and grace. He left behind a legacy that will not be forgotten by those who knew him and loved him.</p><p>He was a coach, a mentor, a friend, a father, and a fighter.</p><p>He was Terry Price.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfqbKzvthmp6uhk5p6pK3UrJxmp5Zisaat06FkoaenYsGpsYytnLGZo2KurnnCqJicoF2bvLazx61kmmWSp663sYybmK2snJp6orPAoqWsrF2Yrq%2BvxKtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bhajan-lal-sharma-net-worth-rajasthan-s-chief-minister-assets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bhajan Lal Sharma Net Worth: Rajasthan's Chief Minister Assets</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./savannah-chrisley-s-ex-fianc%C3%A9-tragically-dies-at-29-his-last-post-about-family-is-earth-shatteri.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Savannah Chrisley's Ex-Fianc Tragically Dies at 29 - His Last Post about Family Is 'Earth-Shatteri</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
