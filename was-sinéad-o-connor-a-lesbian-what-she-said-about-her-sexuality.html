Initially, she publicly declared herself a lesbian, but later on, she shared a different perspective on her sexuality, causing further discussions and debates.</p><p class=dh>In 2000 Sinéad O'Connor set the record straight concerning <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.curvemag.com/blog/interviews/curves-20th-anniversary-retrospective-sinad-oconnor/>her sexual orientation</a> and revealed she identified as lesbian.</p><p class=dh>However, five years later, during an interview, the "Nothing Compares 2 U" singer expressed a different perspective on her sexuality. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://ew.com/article/2012/02/17/ballad-sinead-oconnor/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20three%2Dquarters%20heterosexual%2C%20a%20quarter%20gay">said</a>, "I'm three-quarters heterosexual, a quarter gay."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c62b714406b6878e40f75ed563ff01c40618af1158e9b07f92efb6c7aa137cd7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Sinead O'Connor at Vogue Theatre on February 01, 2020, in Vancouver, Canada. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In 2014, O'Connor provided further clarification when questioned <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://pridesource.com/article/67109-2/#:~:text=I%20think%20if%20you%20fall%20in%20love%20with%20someone">about her sexuality.</a> The acclaimed singer, then 47 years old, expressed that she had grown and evolved in her understanding.</p><p class=dh>The Irish singer emphasized that if she fell in love with someone, their gender wouldn't be a determining factor, and she would be open to a relationship with either a man or a woman. She also mentioned her disbelief in using any label to define relationships or identities.</p><p class=dh>During the same interview, O'Connor shared her journey of connecting with the gay community. Growing up in Ireland, she disclosed that the concept of the gay community was virtually non-existent in the 70s, and she had never even heard the term "gay" used.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/468a173d5bc8b6cbd7e17e0ce142d56fef307150d5ed559c24698fa8beb91398.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Sinead O'Connor at the RTÉ Choice Music Prize at Vicar Street on March 09, 2023, in Dublin, Ireland. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She heard the term from a female impersonator named Danny La Rue, who had a popular TV show during that time. Despite enjoying his show, O'Connor remained unaware of the broader gay community until she reached 17.</p><p class=dh>O'Connor's exposure to the gay community occurred when she moved to London and connected with her cross-dressing cousin. The cousin was the one who introduced her to the world of gay clubs, providing her with her first glimpse into the vibrant and diverse community.</p><p class=dh>In 2014, O'Connor candidly disclosed her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thepinknews.com/2014/10/25/sinead-oconnor-i-want-to-date-women-again-it-isnt-working-with-men/>desire to date women</a>, as she expressed that her past experiences with men in relationships had not been successful. In a now-deleted blog post, the late singer shared her thoughts, revealing that she failed in dating men. She humorously mentioned that people who googled her didn't view her as an ideal prospect for dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d6c35aa35333fe035e9cf896941e8487496ec63b97da0b291324121cde7c77b4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Sinead O'Connor performs live at Campus Industry Music in Parma, Italy, on January 18 2020. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>O'Connor expressed her affection for women, stating that she felt a strong connection and attraction to them.

The two called it quits in 1991 after four years of marriage.</p><p class=dh>The singer found love again with journalist Nick Sommerlad. They got married in a secret ceremony in 2001 but ultimately divorced in 2004.
