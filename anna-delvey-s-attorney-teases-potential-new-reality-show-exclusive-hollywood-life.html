Her story was told in the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a> scripted miniseries <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Inventing Anna</a>, which was based on <strong>Jessica Pressler</strong>‘s&nbsp;New York article, “Maybe She Had So Much Money She Just Lost Track of It.”&nbsp;Anna is now out of prison and the 31-year-old is developing a reality show about her life with her attorney, <strong>Duncan Levin,&nbsp;</strong>who spoke to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY about their upcoming project.</p><p>According to a source close to Anna, whose real name is Anna Sorokin, “She is very pleased to share her artistic ventures with the public. She really appreciates the tremendous outpouring of support that she has gotten.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Anna-Delvey-Potential-Reality-Show-MEGA-embed-1.jpg><p>Anna, who spent 4 years in prison on charges of grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, and theft of services,&nbsp; feels “so lucky to have the opportunity for people to see the real her,” the source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. As for how this project will change Anna’s life moving forward, the source added that Anna thinks it will be “amazing to be in business. She is looking forward to earning a living doing something she loves.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Anna-Delvey-Potential-Reality-Show-MEGA-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Anna was born a Russian immigrant, but she pretended to be a German heiress with a $67 million trust fund as she deceived&nbsp;Manhattan’s elite and defrauded hotels, restaurants, a private jet operator, and banks out of around $275,000 over the course of 10 months. She was released from prison in Feb. 2021 on good behavior, but six weeks later she was taken into ICE custody for overstaying her visa. She was <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>released from ICE custody</a> in October 2022 with help from her attorney.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>HollywoodLife also spoke to Anna’s attorney, Duncan Levin, who explained why this project will show more of the real Anna than the Netflix show that featured Emmy Award winner <strong>Julia Garner</strong>&nbsp;in the lead role. “In her [Anna’s] case, there are so many who had the wrong perception of her, or at least a perception that is very much based on the Netflix series,” Duncan said. “I have found Anna to&nbsp;be a very complex and talented person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Duncan also told us a little bit about the concept of Anna’s upcoming show. “While the press has called the show concept a reality show, it is likely to look much more like an art and design show that she curates and runs,” he explained. “As one can imagine, there are several moving pieces to the opportunities that Anna is fielding and considering.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5FpZpqmnpZ6pbHLr5yyZaKarq2107JkrKCfrHqqutOeqa%2Bhlax8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bro-billy-paul-branham-obituary-well-known-end-time-prophet-passes-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bro Billy Paul Branham obituary: Well-known End-time Prophet passes away</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tracy-feith-for-target.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tracy Feith for Target!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
