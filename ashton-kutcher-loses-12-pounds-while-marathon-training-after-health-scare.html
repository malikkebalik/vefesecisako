My daily motivator is my kids and family,” referencing daughter Wyatt, 7, and son Dimitri, 5.</p><p>Kutcher, who previously announced that he would be running in the race to raise funds and awareness for his organization Thorn, said he hopes his participation in the marathon can make a difference.</p><p>“The marathon itself is an elevating opportunity for the work that we have been doing for over a decade with Thorn. A chance to show the folks that have been working so hard to make our vision reality, that I’m in it with them and willing to go to the last mile,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The series will premiere on Peloton. <span class=credit>aplusk/Instagram</span></figure><p>Thorn, which helps build technology to defend children from sexual abuse, is celebrating its 10-year anniversary.</p><p>“Every move we make is in consideration of creating scalable outcomes that help children have lives where they can just be kids,” Kutcher said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Kutcher says his wife, Mila Kunis, has helped him stay motivated to train. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Kershaw's Chall</span></figure><p>Kutcher has been shaping up for the 26.2-mile race after briefly losing his ability to see, hear and walk due to an autoimmune disorder.</p><p>“Like two years ago, I had this weird, super rare form of vasculitis that, like, knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing, it knocked out, like, all my equilibrium,” the “Just Married” star explained on “Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge” earlier this month, adding that it took about a year to regain strength and his senses.</p><p>Vasculitis is a very rare autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels and restricted blood flow,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Mayo Clinic</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, Kutcher said he has <a href=#>since fully recovered</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2BjmlvaGtgZK60tNOopWajpamwqbHRZqOoq5WoenJ%2BjKmmrqaUqHqistOeqWaglZa5tbSMrJqaqpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boy-without-jaw-who-has-never-spoken-a-word-becomes-a-famous-rapper.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boy without Jaw Who Has Never Spoken a Word Becomes a Famous Rapper</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adande-thorne-youtuber-bio-wiki-age-height-weight-girlfriend-dating-net-worth-career-f.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adande Thorne (Youtuber) Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Net Worth, Career, F</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nasa-creates-new-technology-and-policy-office-in-leadership-reshuffle.html>NASA creates new technology and policy office in leadership reshuffle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./question-about-the-board-in-general-the-young-and-the-restless.html>Question about the board in general - The Young and the Restless</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-things-to-know-about-colombian-singer-hollywood-life.html>5 Things To Know About Colombian Singer Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./camille-ramsey-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>Camille Ramsey - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-gates-kickstarted-his-weight-loss-journey-after-his-partner-s-baby-sucked-on-his-breast.html>Kevin Gates Kickstarted His Weight Loss Journey After His Partner's Baby Sucked On His 'Breast'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
